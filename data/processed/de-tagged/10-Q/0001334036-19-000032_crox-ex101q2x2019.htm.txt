PNC shall provide notice to the Lenders (which may be telephonic or written notice by letter, facsimile or telex) that such Revolving Credit Loans are to be made under this Section 2.5.5 and of the apportionment among the Lenders, and the Lenders shall be unconditionally obligated to fund such Revolving Credit Loans - 42 -(whether or not the conditions specified in Section 2.4.1 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests] are then satisfied) by the time PNC so requests, which shall not be later than 3:00 p.m. on the Business Day after the date the Lenders receive such notice from PNC. (ii)    If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of PNC (as the Swing Loan Lender) any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.5.5(i) by the time specified in Section 2.5.5(i), the Swing Loan Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Loan Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Effective Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swing Loan Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Revolving Credit Loan with respect to such prepayment. A certificate of the Swing Loan Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (ii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.2.5.6    Swing Loans Under Cash Management Agreements.  In addition to making Swing Loans pursuant to the foregoing provisions of Section 2.5.3 [Making Swing Loans], without the requirement for a specific request from the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.4.2 [Swing Loan Requests], PNC as the Swing Loan Lender may make Swing Loans to the Borrowers in accordance with the provisions of the agreements between the Borrowers and such Swing Loan Lender relating to the Borrower’s deposit, sweep and other accounts at such Swing Loan Lender and related arrangements and agreements regarding the management and investment of the Borrower’s cash assets as in effect from time to time (the “Cash Management Agreements”) to the extent of the daily aggregate net negative balance in the Borrower’s accounts which are subject to the provisions of the Cash Management Agreements. Swing Loans made pursuant to this Section 2.5.6 in accordance with the provisions of the Cash Management Agreements shall (i) be subject to the limitations as to aggregate amount set forth in Section 2.1.2 [Swing Loan Commitment], (ii) not be subject to the limitations as to individual amount set forth in Section 2.4.2 [Swing Loan Requests], (iii) be payable by the Borrowers, both as to principal and interest, at the rates and times set forth in the Cash Management Agreements (but in no event later than the Expiration Date), (iv) not be made at any time after such Swing Loan Lender has received written notice of the occurrence of an Event of Default and so long as such shall continue to exist, or, unless consented to by the Required Lenders, a Potential Default and so long as such shall continue to exist, (v) if not repaid by the Borrowers in accordance with the provisions of the Cash Management Agreements, be subject to each Lender’s obligation pursuant to Section 2.5.5 [Borrowings to Repay Swing Loans], and (vi) except as provided in the foregoing subsections (i) through (v), be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Article 2.- 43 -2.6    Notes.  The Obligation of the Borrowers to repay the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Loans made to it by each Lender, together with interest thereon, shall be evidenced by a revolving credit Note and a swing Note dated the Closing Date payable to the order of such Lender in a face amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment or Swing Loan Commitment as applicable, of such Lender.2.7    Use of Proceeds.  The proceeds of the Loans shall be used (i) to pay fees and expenses relating to this transaction, (ii) refinance the Obligations owing under the Existing Credit Agreement, (iii) for Borrowers’ working capital needs and capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes, (iv) to finance Permitted Acquisitions (including fees and expenses related to Permitted Acquisitions), (v) to reimburse drawings under Letters of Credit, and (vi) for other permitted uses hereunder, including, but not limited to, permitted dividends, distributions, purchases, redemptions and retirements of equity interests.2.8    Letter of Credit Subfacility. 2.8.1    Issuance of Letters of Credit.  (i)    The Borrowers may at any time prior to the Expiration Date request the issuance of a standby or trade letter of credit (each a “Letter of Credit”) on behalf of itself or another Loan Party, or the amendment or extension of an existing Letter of Credit, by delivering or transmitting electronically, or having such other Loan Party deliver or transmit electronically to the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a completed application and agreement for letters of credit, or request for such amendment or extension, as applicable, in such form as the Issuing Lender may specify from time to time by no later than 10:00 a.m. at least five (5) Business Days, or such shorter period as may be agreed to by the Issuing Lender, in advance of the proposed date of issuance. The Borrowers shall authorize and direct the Issuing Lender to name the Borrowers as the “Applicant” or “Account Party” of each Letter of Credit. Promptly after receipt of any letter of credit application, the Issuing Lender shall confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit application and if not, such Issuing Lender will provide Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the Issuing Lender has received notice from any Lender, Administrative Agent or the Borrowers, at least one day prior to the requested date of issuance, amendment or extension of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions in Section 7 [Conditions of Lending and Issuance of Letters of Credit] is not satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in reliance on the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.8, the Issuing Lender or any of the Issuing Lender’s Affiliates will issue a Letter of Credit or agree to such amendment or extension, provided that each Letter of Credit shall (A) have a maximum maturity of twelve (12) months from the date of issuance, and (B) in no event expire later than the Expiration Date and provided further that in no event shall (i) the Letter of Credit Obligations exceed, at any one time, $20,000,000 (the “Letter of Credit Sublimit”) or (ii) the Revolving Facility Usage - 44 -exceed, at any one time, the Revolving Credit Commitments. Each request by the Borrowers for the issuance, amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by the Borrowers that they shall be in compliance with the preceding sentence and with Section 7 [Conditions of Lending and Issuance of Letters of Credit] after giving effect to the requested issuance, amendment or extension of such Letter of Credit. Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable Issuing Lender will also deliver to Borrowers and Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. As of the Closing Date, each of the Existing Letters of Credit shall constitute, for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, a Letter of Credit issued and outstanding hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section or this Agreement, (x) no Issuing Lender shall have an obligation to issue a Letter of Credit if the issuance thereof would violate one or more policies of such Issuing Lender applicable to Letters of Credit generally, and (y) HSBC Bank USA, N.A., in its capacity as an Issuing Lender shall not at any time be required to issue a Letter of Credit with a face amount in excess of $5,000,000. (ii)    Notwithstanding Section 2.8.1(i), the Issuing Lender shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Official Body or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Lender from issuing the Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the Issuing Lender or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Official Body with jurisdiction over the Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or the Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Lender with respect to the Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the Issuing Lender any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the Issuing Lender in good faith deems material to it, (B) the issuance of the Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the Issuing Lender applicable to letters of credit generally or (C) any Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the Issuing Lender has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to the Issuing Lender (in its sole discretion) with the Borrowers or such Lender to eliminate the Issuer Lender’s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.9(a)(iv) [Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other Issuer Lender Obligations as to which the Issuing Lender has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion.2.8.2    Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrowers shall pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders a fee (the “Letter of Credit Fee”) equal to the Applicable Letter of Credit Fee Rate times the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit, - 45 -and (ii) to the Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee equal to 0.25% per annum on the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit. All Letter of Credit Fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter. The Borrowers shall also pay to the Issuing Lender for the Issuing Lender’s sole account the Issuing Lender’s then in effect customary fees and administrative expenses payable with respect to the Letters of Credit as the Issuing Lender may generally charge or incur from time to time in connection with the issuance, maintenance, amendment (if any), assignment or transfer (if any), negotiation, and administration of Letters of Credit.2.8.3    Disbursements, Reimbursement. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Lender a participation in such Letter of Credit and each drawing thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender’s Ratable Share of the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively.2.8.3.1    In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent thereof. Provided that it shall have received such notice, the Borrowers shall reimburse (such obligation to reimburse the Issuing Lender shall sometimes be referred to as a “Reimbursement Obligation”) the Issuing Lender prior to 12:00 noon on each date that an amount is paid by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit (each such date, a “Drawing Date”) by paying to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender an amount equal to the amount so paid by the Issuing Lender. In the event the Borrowers fail to reimburse the Issuing Lender (through the Administrative Agent) for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by 12:00 noon on the Drawing Date, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender thereof, and the Borrowers shall be deemed to have requested that Revolving Credit Loans be made by the Lenders under the Base Rate Option to be disbursed on the Drawing Date under such Letter of Credit, subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Loan or Letter of Credit] other than any notice requirements. Any notice given by the Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.8.3.1 may be oral if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.2.8.3.2    Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.8.3.1 make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender an amount in immediately available funds equal to its Ratable Share of the amount of the drawing, whereupon the participating Lenders shall (subject to Section 2.8.3 [Disbursement; Reimbursement]) each be deemed to have made a Revolving Credit Loan under the Base Rate Option to the Borrowers in that amount. If any Lender so notified fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender the amount of such Lender’s Ratable Share of such amount by no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Drawing Date, then interest shall accrue on such Lender’s obligation to make such payment, from the Drawing Date to the date on which such Lender makes such payment (i) at a rate per annum equal to the Effective Federal Funds Rate during the first three (3) days - 46 -following the Drawing Date and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to Loans under the Revolving Credit Base Rate Option on and after the fourth day following the Drawing Date. The Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender will promptly give notice (as described in Section 2.8.3.1 above) of the occurrence of the Drawing Date, but failure of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender to give any such notice on the Drawing Date or in sufficient time to enable any Lender to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Lender from its obligation under this Section 2.8.3.2.2.8.3.3    With respect to any unreimbursed drawing that is not converted into Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option to the Borrowers in whole or in part as contemplated by Section 2.8.3.1, because of the Borrower’s failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Loan or Letter of Credit] other than any notice requirements, or for any other reason, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have incurred from the Issuing Lender a borrowing (each a “Letter of Credit Borrowing”) in the amount of such drawing. Such Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option. Each Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.8.3 [Disbursements, Reimbursement] shall be deemed to be a payment in respect of its participation in such Letter of Credit Borrowing (each a “Participation Advance”) from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.8.3.2.8.4    Repayment of Participation Advances.2.8.4.1    Upon (and only upon) receipt by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender of immediately available funds from the Borrowers (i) in reimbursement of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under the Letter of Credit with respect to which any Lender has made a Participation Advance to the Administrative Agent, or (ii) in payment of interest on such a payment made by the Issuing Lender under such a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Issuing Lender will pay to each Lender, in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent, the amount of such Lender’s Ratable Share of such funds, except the Administrative Agent shall retain for the account of the Issuing Lender the amount of the Ratable Share of such funds of any Lender that did not make a Participation Advance in respect of such payment by the Issuing Lender.2.8.4.2    If the Administrative Agent is required at any time to return to any Loan Party, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or any official in any Insolvency Proceeding, any portion of any payment made by any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section in reimbursement of a payment made under the Letter of Credit or interest or fee thereon, each Lender shall, on demand of the Administrative Agent, forthwith return to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender the amount of its Ratable Share of any amounts so returned by the Administrative Agent plus interest thereon from the date such demand is made to the date such amounts are returned by such Lender to the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the Effective Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time.- 47 -2.8.5    Documentation.  Each Loan Party agrees to be bound by the terms of the Issuing Lender’s application and agreement for letters of credit and the Issuing Lender’s written regulations and customary practices relating to letters of credit, though such interpretation may be different from such Loan Party’s own. In the event of a conflict between such application or agreement and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. It is understood and agreed that, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Issuing Lender shall not be liable for any error, negligence and/or mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in following any Loan Party’s instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or any modifications, amendments or supplements thereto.2.8.6    Determinations to Honor Drawing Requests.  In determining whether to honor any request for drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Lender shall be responsible only to determine that the documents and certificates required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit have been delivered and that they comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit.2.8.7    Nature of Participation and Reimbursement Obligations.  Each Lender’s obligation in accordance with this Agreement to make the Revolving Credit Loans or Participation Advances, as contemplated by Section 2.8.3 [Disbursements, Reimbursement], as a result of a drawing under a Letter of Credit, and the Obligations of the Borrowers to reimburse the Issuing Lender upon a draw under a Letter of Credit, shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.8 under all circumstances, including the following circumstances:(i)    any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Issuing Lender or any of its Affiliates, the Borrowers or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, or which any Loan Party may have against the Issuing Lender or any of its Affiliates, any Lender or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii)    the failure of any Loan Party or any other Person to comply, in connection with a Letter of Credit Borrowing, with the conditions set forth in Sections 2.1 [Revolving Credit Commitments], 2.4 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests; Swing Loan Requests], 2.5 [Making Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Loans; Etc.] or 7.2 [Each Loan or Letter of Credit] or as otherwise set forth in this Agreement for the making of a Revolving Credit Loan, it being acknowledged that such conditions are not required for the making of a Letter of Credit Borrowing and the obligation of the Lenders to make Participation Advances under Section 2.8.3 [Disbursements, Reimbursement];(iii)    any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit;(iv)    any claim of breach of warranty that might be made by any Loan Party or any Lender against any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit, or the existence of any claim, set-off, recoupment, counterclaim, crossclaim, defense or other right which any Loan Party or any Lender may have at any time against a beneficiary, successor beneficiary any transferee or assignee of any Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof (or any Persons for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates or any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection - 48 -with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including any underlying transaction between any Loan Party or Subsidiaries of a Loan Party and the beneficiary for which any Letter of Credit was procured);(v)    the lack of power or authority of any signer of (or any defect in or forgery of any signature or endorsement on) or the form of or lack of validity, sufficiency, accuracy, enforceability or genuineness of any draft, demand, instrument, certificate or other document presented under or in connection with any Letter of Credit, or any fraud or alleged fraud in connection with any Letter of Credit, or the transport of any property or provision of services relating to a Letter of Credit, in each case even if the Issuing Lender or any of its Affiliates has been notified thereof;(vi)    payment by the Issuing Lender or any of its Affiliates under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other document which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;(vii)    the solvency of, or any acts or omissions by, any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit, or any other Person having a role in any transaction or obligation relating to a Letter of Credit, or the existence, nature, quality, quantity, condition, value or other characteristic of any property or services relating to a Letter of Credit;(viii)    any failure by the Issuing Lender or any of its Affiliates to issue any Letter of Credit in the form requested by any Loan Party, unless the Issuing Lender has received written notice from such Loan Party of such failure within three Business Days after the Issuing Lender shall have furnished such Loan Party and the Administrative Agent a copy of such Letter of Credit and such error is material and no drawing has been made thereon prior to receipt of such notice;(ix)    any adverse change in the business, operations, properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of any Loan Party or Subsidiaries of a Loan Party;(x)    any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by any party thereto;(xi)    the occurrence or continuance of an Insolvency Proceeding with respect to any Loan Party;(xii)    the fact that an Event of Default or a Potential Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (xiii)    the fact that the Expiration Date shall have passed or this Agreement or the Commitments hereunder shall have been terminated; and(xiv)    any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. 2.8.8    Indemnity.

As between any Loan Party and the Issuing Lender, or the Issuing Lender’s Affiliates, such Loan Party assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for any of the following, including any losses or damages to any Loan Party or other Person or property relating therefrom: (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for an issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged (even if the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates shall have been notified thereof); (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) the failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit, or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred, to comply fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit or any other claim of any Loan Party against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, or any such transferee, or any dispute between or among any Loan Party and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any such transferee; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates, as applicable, including any act or omission of any Official Body, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of the Issuing Lender’s or its Affiliates rights or powers hereunder. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall relieve the Issuing Lender from liability for the Issuing Lender’s gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment) in connection with actions or omissions described in such clauses (i) through (viii) of such sentence. In no event shall the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates be liable to any Loan Party for any indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or special damages or expenses (including without limitation attorneys’ fees), or for any damages resulting from any change in the value of any property relating to a Letter of Credit. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Issuing Lender and each of its Affiliates (i) may rely on any oral or other communication believed in good faith by the Issuing Lender or such Affiliate to have been authorized or given by or on behalf of the applicant for a - 50 -Letter of Credit, (ii) may honor any presentation if the documents presented appear on their face substantially to comply with the terms and conditions of the relevant Letter of Credit; (iii) may honor a previously dishonored presentation under a Letter of Credit, whether such dishonor was pursuant to a court order, to settle or compromise any claim of wrongful dishonor, or otherwise, and shall be entitled to reimbursement to the same extent as if such presentation had initially been honored, together with any interest paid by the Issuing Lender or its Affiliate; (iv) may honor any drawing that is payable upon presentation of a statement advising negotiation or payment, upon receipt of such statement (even if such statement indicates that a draft or other document is being delivered separately), and shall not be liable for any failure of any such draft or other document to arrive, or to conform in any way with the relevant Letter of Credit; (v) may pay any paying or negotiating bank claiming that it rightfully honored under the laws or practices of the place where such bank is located; and (vi) may settle or adjust any claim or demand made on the Issuing Lender or its Affiliate in any way related to any order issued at the applicant’s request to an air carrier, a letter of guarantee or of indemnity issued to a carrier or any similar document (each an “Order”) and honor any drawing in connection with any Letter of Credit that is the subject of such Order, notwithstanding that any drafts or other documents presented in connection with such Letter of Credit fail to conform in any way with such Letter of Credit.In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions set forth above, any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates under any resulting liability to the Borrowers or any Lender.2.8.10    Issuing Lender Reporting Requirements.

Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.9(i)(D) [Defaulting Lender Waterfall] shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.(C)    Certain Fees. (I)    No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender). (II)    Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Ratable Share of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 5.12 [Cash Collateral]. (III) With respect to any Commitment Fee, or Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.9 [Defaulting Lenders], the Borrowers shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such - 52 -Defaulting Lender’s participation in Letter of Credit Obligations or Swing Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (D) below, (y) pay to each Issuing Lender and Swing Loan Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Lender’s or Swing Loan Lender’s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.(D)     Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s participation in Letter of Credit Obligations and Swing Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Ratable Shares (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Facility Usage of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.(E)    Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swing Loans. If the reallocation described in clause (D) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swing Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Loan Lender’s Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lender’s Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures specified in Section 5.13 [Cash Collateral].(ii)    Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and Swing Loan Lender and Issuing Lender agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions specified therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments under the applicable Facility (without giving effect to Section 2.9(a)(iv) [Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure], whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.(iii)    New Swing Loans/Letters of Credit. So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swing Loan Lender shall not be required to fund any Swing Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swing Loan and (ii) no Issuing - 53 -Lender shall be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.2.10    Increase in Revolving Credit Commitments.2.10.1    Increasing Lenders and New Lenders. The Borrowers may, at any time and from time to time, request that (1) the current Lenders increase their Revolving Credit Commitments (any current Lender which elects to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment shall be referred to as an “Increasing Lender”) or (2) one or more new lenders (each a “New Lender”) join this Agreement and provide a Revolving Credit Commitment hereunder, subject to the following terms and conditions: (i)    No Obligation to Increase. No current Lender shall be obligated to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment and any increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment by any current Lender shall be in the sole discretion of such current Lender.

(iii)    Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments. The aggregate increase of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall not exceed $150,000,000. (iv)    Resolutions; Opinion. The Loan Parties shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on or before the effective date of such increase the following documents in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent: (1) certifications of their corporate secretaries with attached resolutions certifying that the increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment has been approved by such Loan Parties, and (2) an opinion of counsel addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders addressing the authorization and execution of the Loan Documents by, and enforceability of the Loan Documents against, the Loan Parties. (v)    Notes. The Borrowers shall execute and deliver (1) to each Increasing Lender a replacement revolving credit Note reflecting the new amount of such Increasing Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment after giving effect to the increase (and the prior Note issued to such Increasing Lender shall be deemed to be terminated) and (2) to each New Lender a revolving credit Note reflecting the amount of such New Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment. (vi)    Approval of New Lenders. Any New Lender shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). (vii)    Increasing Lenders. Each Increasing Lender shall confirm its agreement to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to an acknowledgement in a form acceptable to the Administrative Agent, signed by it and the Borrowers and delivered to the Administrative Agent at least five (5) calendar days before the effective date of such increase. - 54 -(viii)    New Lenders--Joinder. Each New Lender shall execute a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent pursuant to which such New Lender shall join and become a party to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with a Revolving Credit Commitment in the amount set forth in such lender joinder.2.11    Reduction of Revolving Credit Commitment. The Borrowers shall have the right at any time after the Closing Date upon five (5) calendar days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period of time agreed to by the Administrative Agent) to (x) permanently reduce (ratably among the Lenders in proportion to their Ratable Shares) the Revolving Credit Commitments, in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 and whole multiples of $500,000, provided that the total Revolving Commitments after giving effect to any such reduction shall not be less than $100,000,000, or (y) to terminate completely the Revolving Credit Commitments, in each case, without penalty or premium except as set forth herein, including without limitation, in Section 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender], Section 5.8 [Increased Costs] and Section 5.10 [Indemnity]; provided that any such reduction or termination shall be accompanied by prepayment of the Notes, together with outstanding Commitment Fees, and the full amount of interest accrued on the principal sum to be prepaid (and all amounts referred to in Section 5.10 [Indemnity] hereof) to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate Revolving Facility Usage after giving effect to such prepayments to be equal to or less than the Revolving Credit Commitments as so reduced or terminated. Any notice to reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments under this Section 2.11 shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of all Revolving Credit Commitments delivered by the Borrowers may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrowers (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.2.12    Illegality. If, in any applicable jurisdiction, the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any governmental authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to (i) perform any of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (ii) to fund or maintain its participation in any Loan or (iii) issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any Credit Extension, such Person shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, then, upon the Administrative Agent notifying the Borrowers, and until such notice by such Person is revoked, any obligation of such Person to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any such Credit Extension shall be suspended, and to the extent required by applicable Law, cancelled. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall, (A) repay that Person’s participation in the Loans or other applicable Obligations on the last day of the Interest Period for each Loan or other Obligation occurring after the Administrative Agent has notified the Borrowers or, if earlier, the date specified by such Person in the notice delivered to the Administrative Agent (being no earlier than the last day of any applicable grace period permitted by applicable Law) and (B) take all reasonable actions requested by such Person to mitigate or avoid such illegality.3.    RESERVED4.    ARTICLE 4 - INTEREST RATES- 55 -4.1    Interest Rate Options.  The Borrowers shall pay interest in respect of the outstanding unpaid principal amount of the Loans as selected by it from the Base Rate Option or LIBOR Rate Option set forth below applicable to the Loans, it being understood that, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Borrowers may select different Interest Rate Options and different Interest Periods to apply simultaneously to the Loans comprising different Borrowing Tranches and may convert to or renew one or more Interest Rate Options with respect to all or any portion of the Loans comprising any Borrowing Tranche; provided that there shall not be at any one time outstanding more than seven (7) Borrowing Tranches in the aggregate among all of the Loans and provided further that if an Event of Default or Potential Default exists and is continuing, the Borrowers may not request, convert to, or renew the LIBOR Rate Option for any Loans and the Required Lenders may demand that all existing Borrowing Tranches bearing interest under the LIBOR Rate Option shall be converted immediately to the Base Rate Option, subject to the obligation of the Borrowers to pay any indemnity under Section 5.10 [Indemnity] in connection with such conversion. If at any time the designated rate applicable to any Loan made by any Lender exceeds such Lender’s highest lawful rate, the rate of interest on such Lender’s Loan shall be limited to such Lender’s highest lawful rate.4.1.1    Revolving Credit Interest Rate Options; Swing Loan Interest Rate.  The Borrowers shall have the right to select from the following Interest Rate Options applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans:(i)    Revolving Credit Base Rate Option: A fluctuating rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed) equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, such interest rate to change automatically from time to time effective as of the effective date of each change in the Base Rate; or(ii)    Revolving Credit LIBOR Rate Option: A rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed) equal to the LIBOR Rate as determined for each applicable Interest Period, plus the Applicable Margin.(iii)    Swing Loan Interest Rate.    Subject to Section 4.3 [Interest After Default], only the Base Rate Option applicable to Revolving Credit Loans shall apply to the Swing Loans.4.1.2        [RESERVED]4.1.3    Rate Quotations.  The Borrowers may call the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which a Loan Request is to be delivered to receive an indication of the rates then in effect, but it is acknowledged that such projection shall not be binding on the Administrative Agent or the Lenders nor affect the rate of interest which thereafter is actually in effect when the election is made.4.2    Interest Periods.  At any time when the Borrowers shall select, convert to or renew a LIBOR Rate Option, the Borrowers shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such LIBOR Rate Option by delivering a Loan Request. The notice shall specify an Interest Period during which such Interest Rate Option shall - 56 -apply. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the following provisions shall apply to any selection of, renewal of, or conversion to a LIBOR Rate Option:4.2.1    Amount of Borrowing Tranche.  Each Borrowing Tranche of Loans under the LIBOR Rate Option shall be in integral multiples of, and not less than, the respective amounts specified in Section 2.4.1 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests]; and4.2.2    Renewals.  In the case of the renewal of a LIBOR Rate Option at the end of an Interest Period, the first day of the new Interest Period shall be the last day of the preceding Interest Period, without duplication in payment of interest for such day.4.3    Interest After Default.  To the extent permitted by Law, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and until such time such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived, and at the discretion of the Administrative Agent or upon written demand by the Required Lenders to the Administrative Agent:4.3.1    Letter of Credit Fees, Interest Rate.  The Letter of Credit Fees and the rate of interest for each Loan otherwise applicable pursuant to Section 2.8.2 [Letter of Credit Fees] or Section 4.1 [Interest Rate Options], respectively, shall be increased by 2.0% per annum;4.3.2    Other Obligations.  Each other Obligation hereunder if not paid when due shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the rate of interest applicable under the Revolving Credit Base Rate Option plus an additional 2.0% per annum from the time such Obligation becomes due and payable and until it is paid in full; and4.3.3    Acknowledgment.  The Borrowers acknowledge that the increase in rates referred to in this Section 4.3 reflects, among other things, the fact that such Loans or other amounts have become a substantially greater risk given their default status and that the Lenders are entitled to additional compensation for such risk; and all such interest shall be payable by Borrowers upon demand by Administrative Agent.4.4    LIBOR Rate Unascertainable; Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available.4.4.1    Unascertainable.  If on any date on which a LIBOR Rate would otherwise be determined, the Administrative Agent shall have determined that:(i)    adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining such LIBOR Rate, (ii)    a contingency has occurred which materially and adversely affects the London interbank eurodollar market relating to the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent’s and Lender’s Rights], or(iii)    the applicable supervisor or administrator (if any) of the LIBOR Rate or an Official Body having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying the specific date after which the LIBOR Rate shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans (either such date, a “LIBOR Termination Date”), or a rate other than the - 57 -LIBOR Rate has become a widely recognized benchmark rate for newly originated loans in Dollars in the U.S. market, then the Administrative Agent may (in consultation with the Borrowers) choose a replacement index for the LIBOR Rate and make adjustments to applicable margins and related amendments to this Agreement as referred to below such that, to the extent practicable, the all-in interest rate based on the replacement index will be substantially equivalent to the all-in LIBOR Rate-based interest rate in effect prior to its replacement. In such event:(A)    The Administrative Agent and the Borrowers shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect the replacement index, the adjusted margins and such other related amendments as may be appropriate, in the reasonable discretion of the Administrative Agent, for the implementation and administration of the replacement index-based rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, Section 11.2), such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement at 5:00 p.m. on the tenth (10th) Business Day after the date a draft of the amendment is provided to the Lenders, unless the Administrative Agent receives, on or before such tenth (10th) Business Day, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that such Lenders object to such amendment.(B)    Selection of the replacement index, adjustments to the applicable margins, and amendments to this Agreement (I) will be determined with due consideration to the then-current market practices for determining and implementing a rate of interest for newly originated loans in the United States and loans converted from a LIBOR Rate-based rate to a replacement index-based rate, and (II) may also reflect adjustments to account for (x) the effects of the transition from the LIBOR Rate to the replacement index and (y) yield- or risk-based differences between the LIBOR Rate and the replacement index.(C)    Until an amendment reflecting a new replacement index in accordance with this Section 4.4.1(iii) is effective, each advance, conversion and renewal of a Loan to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies will continue to bear interest with reference to the LIBOR Rate; provided however, that if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be final and conclusive, absent manifest error) that a LIBOR Termination Date has occurred, then following the LIBOR Termination Date, all Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies shall automatically be converted to the Base Rate Option until such time as an amendment reflecting a replacement index and related matters as described above is implemented. In the event that the Required Lenders have provided a written notice pursuant to Section 4.4.1(iii)(A) objecting to an amendment, the Lenders agree to work with the Borrowers in good faith to timely determine and implement the replacement index-based rate.(D)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time the replacement index is less than zero, at such times, such index shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of this Agreement.4.4.2    Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available.  If at any time any Lender shall have determined that:- 58 -(i)    the making, maintenance or funding of any Loan to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies has been made impracticable or unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any Law or any interpretation or application thereof by any Official Body or with any request or directive of any such Official Body (whether or not having the force of Law), or(ii)    such LIBOR Rate Option will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lender of the establishment or maintenance of any such Loan, or(iii)    after making all reasonable efforts, deposits of the relevant amount in Dollars for the relevant Interest Period for a Loan, or to banks generally, to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies, respectively, are not available to such Lender with respect to such Loan, or to banks generally, in the interbank eurodollar market, then the Administrative Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent’s and Lender’s Rights].4.4.3    Administrative Agent’s and Lender’s Rights.  In the case of any event specified in Section 4.4.1 [Unascertainable] above, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Lenders and the Borrowers thereof, and in the case of an event specified in Section 4.4.2 [Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available] above, such Lender shall promptly so notify the Administrative Agent and endorse a certificate to such notice as to the specific circumstances of such notice, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly send copies of such notice and certificate to the other Lenders and the Borrowers. Upon such date as shall be specified in such notice (which shall not be earlier than the date such notice is given), the obligation of (A) the Lenders, in the case of such notice given by the Administrative Agent, or (B) such Lender, in the case of such notice given by such Lender, to allow the Borrowers to select, convert to or renew a LIBOR Rate Option shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall have later notified the Borrowers, or such Lender shall have later notified the Administrative Agent, of the Administrative Agent’s or such Lender’s, as the case may be, determination that the circumstances giving rise to such previous determination no longer exist. If at any time the Administrative Agent makes a determination under Section 4.4.1 [Unascertainable] and the Borrowers have previously notified the Administrative Agent of its selection of, conversion to or renewal of a LIBOR Rate Option and such Interest Rate Option has not yet gone into effect, such notification shall be deemed to provide for selection of, conversion to or renewal of the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loans. If any Lender notifies the Administrative Agent of a determination under Section 4.4.2 [Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available], the Borrowers shall, subject to the Borrowers’ indemnification Obligations under Section 5.10 [Indemnity], as to any Loan of the Lender to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies, on the date specified in such notice either convert such Loan to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan or prepay such Loan in accordance with Section 5.6 [Voluntary Prepayments]. Absent due notice from the Borrowers of conversion or prepayment, such Loan shall automatically be converted to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan upon such specified date.4.5    Selection of Interest Rate Options.  If the Borrowers fail to select a new Interest Period to apply to any Borrowing Tranche of Loans under the LIBOR Rate Option at the expiration of an existing Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing Tranche in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.2 [Interest Periods], the Borrowers shall be deemed to have converted such - 59 -Borrowing Tranche to the Base Rate Option commencing upon the last day of the existing Interest Period. If the Borrowers provide any Loan Request related to a Loan at the LIBOR Rate Option but fails to identify an Interest Period therefor, such Loan Request shall be deemed to request an Interest Period of one (1) month. Any Loan Request that fails to select an Interest Rate Option shall be deemed to be a request for the Base Rate Option.5.    PAYMENTS5.1    Payments.  All payments and prepayments to be made in respect of principal, interest, Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, Administrative Agent’s Fee or other fees or amounts due from the Borrowers hereunder shall be payable prior to 1:00 p.m. on the date when due without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers, and without set-off, counterclaim or other deduction of any nature, and an action therefor shall immediately accrue. Such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Principal Office for the account of Swing Loan Lender with respect to the Swing Loans and for the ratable accounts of the Lenders with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans in U.S. Dollars and in immediately available funds, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute such amounts to the Lenders in immediately available funds; provided that in the event payments are received by 1:00 p.m. by the Administrative Agent with respect to the Loans and such payments are not distributed to the Lenders on the same day received by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall pay the Lenders the Effective Federal Funds Rate with respect to the amount of such payments for each day held by the Administrative Agent and not distributed to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent’s and each Lender’s statement of account, ledger or other relevant record shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive as the statement of the amount of principal of and interest on the Loans and other amounts owing under this Agreement and shall be deemed an “account stated.”5.2    Pro Rata Treatment of Lenders.  Each borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans shall be allocated to each Lender according to its Ratable Share, and each selection of, conversion to or renewal of any Interest Rate Option and each payment or prepayment by the Borrowers with respect to principal, interest, Commitment Fees and Letter of Credit Fees (but excluding the Administrative Agent’s Fee and the Issuing Lender’s fronting fee) shall (except as otherwise may be provided with respect to a Defaulting Lender and except as provided in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent’s and Lender’s Rights] in the case of an event specified in Section 4.4 [LIBOR Rate Unascertainable; Etc.], 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender] or 5.8 [Increased Costs]) be payable ratably among the Lenders entitled to such payment in accordance with the amount of principal, interest, Commitment Fees and Letter of Credit Fees, as set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each borrowing or payment or prepayment by the Borrowers of principal, interest, fees or other amounts from the Borrowers with respect to Swing Loans shall be made by or to Swing Loan Lender according to Section 2.5.5 [Borrowings to Repay Swing Loans].5.3    Sharing of Payments by Lenders.  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff, counterclaim or banker’s lien, by receipt of voluntary payment, by realization upon security, or by any other non-pro rata source, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender’s receiving payment of a - 60 -proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than the pro-rata share of the amount such Lender is entitled thereto, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:(i)    if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, together with interest or other amounts, if any, required by Law (including court order) to be paid by the Lender or the holder making such purchase; and(ii)    the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Loan Parties pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of the Loan Documents or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or Participation Advances to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrowers or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall apply).Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation but without duplication as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Loan Party in the amount of such participation.5.4    Presumptions by Administrative Agent.  (i)    Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender (x) in the case of Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies 4 hours prior to the proposed time of such Borrowing Tranche of Loans and (y) otherwise, prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing Tranche of Loans that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s Ratable Share, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.5.1 [Making Revolving Credit Loans] or Section 2.8.7 [Nature of Participation and Reimbursement Obligations] and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing Tranche of Loans available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrowers to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Effective Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrowers, the interest rate applicable to Loans under the Base Rate Option. If the Borrowers and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping - 61 -period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrowers the amount of such interest paid by the Borrowers for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing Tranche of Loans to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing Tranche of Loans. Any payment by the Borrowers shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrowers may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.(ii)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Effective Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.5.5    Interest Payment Dates.  Interest on Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies shall be due and payable in arrears on each Payment Date. Interest on Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies shall be due and payable on the last day of each Interest Period for those Loans (and, if such Interest Period is longer than three (3) Months, also on the 90th and 180th day of such Interest Period). Interest on the principal amount of each Loan or other monetary Obligation shall be due and payable on demand after such principal amount or other monetary Obligation becomes due and payable (whether on the stated Expiration Date, upon acceleration or otherwise).5.6    Voluntary Prepayments.5.6.1    Right to Prepay.  The Borrowers shall have the right at its option from time to time to prepay the Loans in whole or part without premium or penalty (except as provided in Section 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender] below, in Section 5.8 [Increased Costs] and Section 5.10 [Indemnity]). Whenever the Borrowers desire to prepay any part of the Loans, it shall provide a prepayment notice to the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of prepayment of the Revolving Credit Loans or no later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of prepayment of Swing Loans, setting forth the following information:(w)    the date, which shall be a Business Day, on which the proposed prepayment is to be made;(x)    a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between the Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Loans;(y)    a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies and Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies; and- 62 -(z)    the total principal amount of such prepayment, which shall not be less than the lesser of (i) the Revolving Facility Usage or (ii) $500,000 for any Swing Loan or $500,000 for any Revolving Credit Loan.All prepayment notices shall be irrevocable; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of all Revolving Credit Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.11 [Reduction of Revolving Credit Commitment], then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.11 [Reduction of Revolving Credit Commitment]. The principal amount of the Loans for which a prepayment notice is given, together with interest on such principal amount except with respect to Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, shall be due and payable on the date specified in such prepayment notice as the date on which the proposed prepayment is to be made. Except as provided in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent’s and Lender’s Rights], if the Borrowers prepay a Loan but fail to specify the applicable Borrowing Tranche which the Borrowers are prepaying, the prepayment shall be applied first to Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, then to Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 5.9.5    Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of any of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.9.4 [Participations] relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register, and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Official Body.

If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.9 [Taxes] (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 5.9 [Taxes]), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but - 68 -only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 5.9 [Taxes] with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Official Body with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party incurred in connection with obtaining such refund, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 5.9.8 [Treatment of Certain Refunds] (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Official Body) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Official Body. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.9.8 [Treatment of Certain Refunds]), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 5.9.8 [Treatment of Certain Refunds] the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.5.9.9    Survival.

In addition to the compensation or payments required by Section 5.8 [Increased Costs]or Section 5.9 [Taxes], the Borrowers shall indemnify each Lender against all liabilities, losses or expenses (including loss of anticipated profits, any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan, from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract) which such Lender sustains or incurs as a consequence of any:(i)    payment, prepayment, conversion or renewal of any Loan to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies on a day other than the last day of the corresponding Interest Period (whether or not such payment or prepayment is mandatory, voluntary or automatic and whether or not such payment or prepayment is then due),(ii)    attempt by the Borrowers to revoke (expressly, by later inconsistent notices or otherwise) in whole or part any Loan Requests under Section 2.4 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests; Swing Loan Requests] or Section 4.2 [Interest Periods] or notice relating to prepayments under Section 5.6 [Voluntary Prepayments] or failure by the Borrowers (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Loan under the Base Rate Option on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrowers, (iii)    any assignment of a Loan under the LIBOR Rate Option on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender],- 69 -(iv)    default by the Borrowers in the performance or observance of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including any failure of the Borrowers to pay when due (by acceleration or otherwise) any principal, interest, Commitment Fee or any other amount due hereunder.If any Lender sustains or incurs any such loss or expense, it shall promptly upon knowledge of such loss or expense notify the Borrowers of the amount determined in good faith by such Lender (which determination may include such assumptions, allocations of costs and expenses and averaging or attribution methods as such Lender shall deem reasonable) to be necessary to indemnify such Lender for such loss or expense. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination. Such amount shall be due and payable by the Borrowers to such Lender ten (10) Business Days after such notice is given.5.11    Settlement Date Procedures. In order to minimize the transfer of funds between the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers may borrow, repay and reborrow Swing Loans and PNC may make Swing Loans as provided in Section 2.1.2 [Swing Loan Commitments] hereof during the period between Settlement Dates. The Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of its Ratable Share of the total of the Revolving Credit Loans and the Swing Loans (each a “Required Share”). On such Settlement Date, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent the amount equal to the difference between its Required Share and its Revolving Credit Loans, and the Administrative Agent shall pay to each Lender its Ratable Share of all payments made by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans. The Administrative Agent shall also effect settlement in accordance with the foregoing sentence on the proposed Borrowing Dates for Revolving Credit Loans and on any mandatory prepayment date as provided for herein and may at its option effect settlement on any other Business Day. These settlement procedures are established solely as a matter of administrative convenience, and nothing contained in this Section 5.11 shall relieve the Lenders of their obligations to fund Revolving Credit Loans on dates other than a Settlement Date pursuant to Section 2.1.2 [Swing Loan Commitment]. The Administrative Agent may at any time at its option for any reason whatsoever require each Lender to pay immediately to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s Ratable Share of the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and each Lender may at any time require the Administrative Agent to pay immediately to such Lender its Ratable Share of all payments made by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans.5.12    Mitigation Obligations. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 5.8, or the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Official Body for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.9, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or materially reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.8 or 5.9, as the case may be, in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense, (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect and (iv) would not require such Lender to take any action inconsistent with its internal policies or legal or regulatory restrictions. The - 70 -Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.5.13    Cash Collateral. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one (1) Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) the Borrowers shall Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lender’s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 2.9(i)(D) [Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure] and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount.(i)    Grant of Security Interest. The Borrowers, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Lender, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lenders’ obligation to fund participations in respect of Letter of Credit Obligations, to be applied pursuant to clause (b) below. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender as herein provided or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrowers will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).(ii)    Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 5.13 or Section 2.9 [Defaulting Lender] in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender’s obligation to fund participations in respect of Letter of Credit Obligations (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.(iii)    Termination of Requirement. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce the Issuing Lender’s Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 5.13 following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to Section 2.9 [Default Lenders], the Person providing Cash Collateral and the Issuing Lender may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations and provided further that to the extent that such Cash Collateral was provided by the Borrowers, such Cash Collateral shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to Section 5.13(i) above.6.    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES- 71 -6.1    Representations and Warranties.

Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender hereby irrevocably appoints PNC to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Section 10 are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, and neither the Borrowers nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.10.2    Rights as a Lender.  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.10.3    Exculpatory Provisions.  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:- 99 -(a)    shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Potential Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;(b)    shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and(c)    shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrowers or any of their Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 11.2 [Modifications, Amendments or Waivers] and 9.2 [Consequences of Event of Default]) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Potential Default or Event of Default unless and until notice describing such Potential Default or Event of Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrowers, a Lender or the Issuing Lender.The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Potential Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 7 [Conditions of Lending and Issuance of Letters of Credit] or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.10.4    Reliance by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon - 100 -any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the Issuing Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.10.5    Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub‑agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub‑agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Section 10 shall apply to any such sub‑agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub‑agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.10.6    Resignation of Administrative Agent. (i)     The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Lender and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with approval from the Borrowers (so long as no Potential Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Resignation Effective Date”), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications specified above; provided that in no event shall any such successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.(ii)    If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrowers and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, with approval from the Borrowers, appoint a successor, such approval not to be - 101 -unreasonably withheld or delayed. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Removal Effective Date”), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.(iii)    With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (i) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and Issuing Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor. After the retiring or removed Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 11.4 [Expense; Indemnity; Damage Waiver] shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub‑agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.10.7    Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.  Each Lender and the Issuing Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the Issuing Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.10.8    No Other Duties, etc.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Lenders listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Lender hereunder.- 102 -10.9    Administrative Agent’s Fee.

(i)    Each of the Secured Parties irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion:(A)    to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (x) upon the Expiration Date, (y) that is sold or otherwise disposed of or to be sold or otherwise disposed of as part of or in connection with any sale or other disposition permitted under the Loan Documents, or (z) subject to Section 11.2 [Modifications; Amendment or Waivers], if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders;(B)    to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that secures Purchase Money Indebtedness; and(C)    to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty Agreement if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents.Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent’s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.10.(ii)    The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Administrative Agent’s Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection therewith, nor shall the Administrative Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral.10.11    No Reliance on Administrative Agent’s Customer Identification Program.  Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that neither such Lender, nor any of its Affiliates, participants or assignees, may rely on the Administrative Agent to carry out such Lender’s, Affiliate’s, participant’s or assignee’s customer identification program, or other obligations required or imposed under or pursuant to the USA Patriot Act or the regulations thereunder, including the regulations contained in 31 CFR 103.121 (as hereafter amended or replaced, the “CIP Regulations”), or any other Anti-Terrorism and Sanctions Law or any Anti-Corruption Law, including any programs involving any of the following items relating to or in connection with any of the Loan Parties, their Affiliates or their agents, the Loan Documents or the transactions hereunder or contemplated hereby: (i) any - 103 -identity verification procedures, (ii) any recordkeeping, (iii) comparisons with government lists, (iv) customer notices or (v) other procedures required under the CIP Regulations or such other Laws. 10.12    Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or Letter of Credit Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:(i)    to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, Letter of Credit Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.8.2 [Letter of Credit Fees] and 11.4 [Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver]) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and(ii)    to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and the Issuing Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Section 11.4 [Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver].10.12.1    Lender Provided Interest Rate Hedges, Lender Provided Foreign Currency Hedges and Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products. Except as otherwise expressly specified herein, no Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank that obtains the benefits of Section 9.2.4 [Application of Proceeds], the Guaranty Agreement or any Collateral by virtue of the provisions hereof or of the Guaranty Agreement or any Loan Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral) other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 10 to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Obligations arising under Lender Provided Interest Rate Hedges, Lender Provided Foreign Currency Hedges and/or Other Lender Provided Financial Service Products unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Obligations, - 104 -together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be.10.13    Parallel liability.

Such register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is in such register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.

Each Lender that sells participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrowers to effectuate the provisions of Section 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender] with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.2.3 [Set-off] as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 5.3 [Sharing of Payments by Lenders] as though it were a Lender.

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.11.9.5    Certain Pledges; Successors and Assigns Generally.

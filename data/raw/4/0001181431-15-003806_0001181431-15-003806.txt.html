        <footnote id="F1">Represents 82,500 restricted stock units granted to the reporting person under the issuer's 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (as Amended and Restated).  Each restricted stock unit represents the contingent right to receive one share of the issuer's common stock.  The restricted stock units vest as follows:  (i) 17,500 of the restricted stock units vest in three equal annual installments on March 1, 2016, March 1, 2017 and March 1, 2018, provided that the reporting person remains employed by the issuer as of each vesting date, and (ii) up to 65,000 of the restricted stock units vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the date in 2016 that the issuer's compensation committee certifies that certain performance metrics are achieved, provided that the reporting person remains employed by the issuer as of each vesting date.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Adjusted to reflect 93,646 restricted stock units that were cancelled as certain performance metrics relating to the vesting of such awards were not achieved.</footnote>

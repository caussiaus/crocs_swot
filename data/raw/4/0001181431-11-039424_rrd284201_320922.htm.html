POWER OF ATTORNEY

	I, Thomas J. Smach, hereby authorize and designate each of Dan
Hart, Jeff Lasher and Jason Day, signing singly, as my true and lawful
attorney-in-fact to:

	(1)	execute for and on my behalf, in my capacity as an officer
and/or director of CROCS INC. and its affiliates (the "Company"), the Form ID
and Forms 3, 4 and 5 in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder;

	(2)	do and perform any and all acts for and on my behalf which may
be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form ID or Form 3,
4 or 5 and timely file such form with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
any stock exchange or similar authority; and

	(3)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection
with the foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be to
my benefit, in my best interest, or legally required of me, it being
understood that the statements executed by such attorney-in-fact on my behalf
pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall contain
such terms and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in such
attorney-in-fact's discretion.

	I hereby further grant to each such attorney-in-fact full power and
authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
necessary, or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and
powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as I might or
could do if personally present, with full power of substitutes or revocation,
hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney-in-fact, or such
attorney-in- fact's substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to
be done by virtue of this Power of Attorney and the rights and powers herein
granted.  I hereby acknowledge that the foregoing attorneys-in-fact, in
serving in such capacity at my request, are not assuming, nor is the Company
assuming, any of my responsibilities to comply with Section 16 of the
Exchange Act.

	This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until I
am no longer required to file the Form ID or Forms 3, 4 and 5 with respect to
my holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the Company, unless
earlier revoked by me in a signed writing delivered to the foregoing
attorneys-in-fact.

	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have caused this Power of Attorney to be duly
executed as of this 28 day of June, 2011.

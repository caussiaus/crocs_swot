	(1)	execute for and on my behalf, in my capacity as an officer
and/or director of CROCS INC. and its affiliates (the "Company"), the Form ID
and Forms 3, 4 and 5 in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder;

	(2)	do and perform any and all acts for and on my behalf which may
be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form ID or Form 3,
4 or 5 and timely file such form with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
any stock exchange or similar authority; and

	(3)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection
with the foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be to
my benefit, in my best interest, or legally required of me, it being
understood that the statements executed by such attorney-in-fact on my behalf
pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall contain
such terms and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in such
attorney-in-fact's discretion.

	I hereby further grant to each such attorney-in-fact full power and
authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
necessary, or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and
powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as I might or

hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney-in-fact, or such
attorney-in- fact's substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to

	This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until I
am no longer required to file the Form ID or Forms 3, 4 and 5 with respect to
my holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the Company, unless
earlier revoked by me in a signed writing delivered to the foregoing

	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have caused this Power of Attorney to be duly

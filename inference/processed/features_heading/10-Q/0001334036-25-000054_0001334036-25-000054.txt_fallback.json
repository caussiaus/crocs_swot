    "We continue to operate in an environment where consumers are feeling the effects of elevated interest rates and inflation, among other things, and as a result, they are spending more unpredictably. In addition, geopolitical tensions have increased across the globe. In March 2025, the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) clarified no additional tariffs are due on goods from Mexico that qualify for preferential treatment under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d). Our products currently qualify for USMCA preference, and as such, the additional tariff on imports from Mexico is not applicable to us. In April 2025, the U.S. imposed a minimum 10% tariff on most foreign imports into the U.S. and additional individualized reciprocal tariffs on imports from certain countries, including, most relevant to us, an additional 125% tariff on all imports from China for a total incremental tariff of 145% and an additional 46%, 32%, 26%, and 49% tariff on all imports from Vietnam, Indonesia, India, and Cambodia, respectively. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, implementation of the reciprocal tariffs, other than those levied on China, has been declared to be temporarily paused. We are continuing to monitor developments with respect to these policy changes and proposals, as well as exploring options to mitigate potential impacts of tariffs, including diversifying our sourcing mix, reducing product costs, and evaluating the potential for price increases. See the risk factor under \u201cGovernment actions and regulations, such as export restrictions, tariffs, and other trade protection measures could adversely affect our business\u201d in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d under Item 1A in this report for additional information.",

      "_Revenues_****.** During the three months ended March 31, 2013, revenues increased $39.9 million, or 14.7%, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to an increase of 1.6 million, or 12.1%, in global footwear unit sales and an increase of $0.67, or 3.5%, in average footwear selling price. For the three months ended March 31, 2013, revenues from our wholesale channel increased $29.6 million, or 15.5% compared to the same period in 2012, which was primarily driven by increased wholesale sales in Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe partially offset by a decrease in Japan. Revenues from our retail channel increased $10.5 million, or 17.4% compared to the same period in 2012, primarily driven by strong demand in all four reportable segments as well as continued growth of our retail presence by opening 107 retail stores (net of store closures) within the past year. We also continue to close certain kiosks as branded stores allow us to better merchandise the full breadth and depth of our product line. Revenues from our internet channel decreased $0.3 million, or 1.2%, compared to the same period in 2012. Typically, our wholesale business outperforms our consumer-direct business in the first and second quarters of the year as customers accumulate inventory for the spring and summer months. The first quarter on average represents just over 15% of retail sales for the year; therefore, we remain confident that we can achieve modest year-over-year comparable store sales growth similar to 2012 growth rates.",

We have since implemented a foreign currency hedging strategy and as a result, we have been able to reduce the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial statements."

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Unless otherwise noted in this report, any description of "we," "us" or "our" includes Crocs, Inc. ("Crocs" or the "Company,") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries within our reportable operating segments and corporate operations. The Company is engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, worldwide marketing and distribution of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children. We strive to be the global leader in the sale of molded footwear featuring fun, comfort, color, and functionality. Our reportable operating segments include: the Americas, operating in North and South America; Asia Pacific, operating throughout Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Africa and the Middle East; and Europe, operating throughout Europe and Russia.The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and reflect all adjustments which are necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP"). Such unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 ("Annual Report"), and have been prepared on a consistent basis with the accounting policies described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements ("Notes") included in our Annual Report. Our accounting policies did not change in the first quarter of 2017, except for the new accounting pronouncements adopted as described in Note 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements.Seasonality of BusinessDue to the seasonal nature of our footwear, which is more heavily focused on styles suitable for warmer weather, the Company's business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in its first and second quarters and higher retail sales in its second and third quarters. In addition, our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of other factors, including general economic conditions or consumer confidence. Accordingly, the Company's operating results and cash flows for the three-months ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results and cash flows for any other quarter or for the full year.Transactions with AffiliatesThe Company receives services from three subsidiaries of Blackstone Capital Partners VI L.P. (“Blackstone”). Blackstone and certain of its permitted transferees currently beneficially own all the outstanding shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, which is convertible into approximately 15.7% of the Company’s common stock as of March 31, 2017. Two Blackstone representatives also serve on the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”).Certain Blackstone subsidiaries provide various services, including inventory count, cybersecurity and consulting, and workforce management services. The Company paid $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively for these services. Expenses related to these services are reported in ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.Research, Design and Development ExpensesResearch, design and development expenses were $2.9 million and $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are reported in 'Selling, general and administrative expenses' in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.5Table of ContentsAdvertising and Promotional ExpensesProduction costs of advertising and promotion costs are expensed when the advertising is first run. Advertising communication costs are expensed in the periods that the communications occur. Certain of the Company’s promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. Payments under endorsement contracts are expensed on a straight-line basis over the related annual contract terms. Prepaid advertising and promotional endorsement costs of $3.2 million and $4.5 million were included in other ‘Prepaids and other current assets’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Total advertising, production, promotional and agency expenses were $12.0 million and $8.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Depreciation ExpenseDepreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment reported in ‘Cost of sales’ and ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ was: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands)Selling, general and administrative expenses$3,191 $3,313Cost of sales553 387Total depreciation expense$3,744 $3,700 2. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  New Accounting Pronouncement Adopted Inventory MeasurementIn July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance to measure in-scope inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2017 on a prospective basis. The adoption did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedClarifying the Definition of a BusinessIn January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to clarify the definition of a business, for purposes of determining whether a business has been acquired or sold, and consequently whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of a business, or as acquisitions or disposals of assets. This guidance is to be applied prospectively and becomes effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.Statement of Cash Flows - Classification and Change in CashIn August 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. Further, in November 2016, the FASB issued guidance requiring that restricted cash be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. These updates are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The guidance should be applied retrospectively unless it is impractical to do so; in which case, the guidance should be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.6Table of ContentsPrepaid Stored-Value ProductsIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to the recognition of breakage for certain prepaid stored-value products. This update aligns recognition of the financial liabilities related to prepaid stored-value products (for example, prepaid gift cards), with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for non-financial liabilities. In general, certain of these liabilities may be extinguished proportionally in earnings as redemptions occur, or when redemption is remote if issuers are not entitled to the unredeemed stored value. This standard is effective for annual periods (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. At adoption, this update will be applied either using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective or retrospectively to each period presented. The Company is currently assessing the adoption method and the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, measured on a discounted basis, at the commencement date for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. Additionally, this guidance will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases, including qualitative and quantitative requirements. The guidance should be applied under a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the adoption-period financial statements. Any leases that expire before the initial application date will not require any accounting adjustment. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted.The Company will adopt this guidance beginning with the quarterly reporting period ending March 31, 2019. The Company is evaluating the full impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements, and expects that adoption will result in significant increases in lease related assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet.Revenue RecognitionIn May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services. Subsequent to the release of this guidance, the FASB has issued additional updates intended to provide interpretive clarifications and to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue recognition standard both at transition and on an ongoing basis. The new standard and related amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. Upon adoption of the new standard, the use of either a full retrospective or cumulative effect transition method is permitted.In December 2016, the Company established an implementation team and engaged external advisers to develop a multi-phase plan to assess the Company’s business and contracts, as well as any changes to accounting policies, processes or systems necessary to adopt the requirements of the new standard. The Company has completed an initial review of its revenue contracts and terms and is assessing how adoption of the new standard will affect its consolidated financial statements and disclosures, as well as the adoption method. The Company is continuing its evaluation of the impact of the accounting and disclosure changes, and method of adoption, on its business processes, controls and systems. The Company will provide additional information regarding expected effects on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures, and the transition method in subsequent quarterly reports.Other PronouncementsOther new pronouncements issued but not effective until after March 31, 2017 are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.7Table of Contents3.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  Recurring Fair Value Measurements U.S. GAAP for fair value establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach). The Company utilizes a combination of market and income approaches to value derivative instruments. The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:Level 1Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.Level 2Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities; or Unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.Level 3Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.The financial assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis consist of the Company's derivative instruments. The Company's derivative instruments are foreign currency forward exchange contracts. The Company manages credit risk of its derivative instruments on the basis of its net exposure with its counterparty and has elected to measure the fair value in the same manner. All of the Company's derivative instruments are classified as Level 2 and are reported within 'Accrued expenses and other liabilities' in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. There were no transfers between Level 1 or Level 2, nor were there any outstanding derivative instruments classified as Level 3 as of March 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016. The fair value of the Company's derivative instruments was a liability of $1.3 million and $0.2 million at March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. See Note 7 — Derivative Financial Instruments for more information.9Table of ContentsThe carrying amounts of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and current accrued liabilities approximate their fair value as recorded due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.The Company's borrowing instruments are recorded at their carrying values in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, which may differ from their respective fair values. The fair values of the Company's notes payable outstanding approximate their carrying values at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 based on interest rates currently available to the Company for similar borrowings. March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value (in thousands)Borrowings and capital lease obligations$4,502 $4,502 $2,378 $2,378Non-Financial Assets and LiabilitiesThe Company's non-financial assets, which primarily consist of property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying value. However, on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be fully recoverable (and at least annually for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets), non-financial instruments are assessed for impairment and, if applicable, written down to and recorded at fair value.The Company did not record impairment during the three months ended March 31, 2017. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company recorded non-cash impairment of $0.2 million to reduce the carrying values of certain retail store assets to their estimated fair value. Impairments are reported in 'Selling, general and administrative expenses' in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair values of these assets were determined based on Level 3 measurements, including estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows based upon historical experience, expected market conditions, and management's plans. Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands)Retail store asset impairment$— $1937. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  The Company transacts business in various foreign countries and is therefore exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk that impacts the reported U.S. Dollar amounts of revenues, costs, and certain foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. In order to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency and to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company enters into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currency. By policy, the Company does not enter into these contracts for trading purposes or speculation. Counterparty default risk is considered low because the forward contracts that the Company enters into are over-the-counter instruments transacted with highly-rated financial institutions. The Company was not required and did not post collateral as of March 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.The Company's derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company reports derivative instruments with the same counterparty on a net basis when a master netting arrangement is in place. Changes in fair value are recognized within 'Foreign currency gain (loss), net' in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

INCOME TAXESIncome tax expense and effective tax rates were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016Income before income taxes$15,948 $13,051Income tax expense4,938 2,905Effective tax rate31.0% 22.1%During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the increase in effective tax rate, compared to the same period in 2016, is primarily due to operating losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company is unable to record tax benefits because it has determined that it is not more likely than not that such tax benefits will be realized, as well as an increase in profitability in certain jurisdictions for which tax expense is recorded. The Company’s effective income tax rate, for each period presented, also differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate primarily due to differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions as well as book losses in certain jurisdictions for which tax benefits cannot be recognized. There were no significant or unusual discrete tax items during the quarter. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $5.2 million and $4.8 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and the Company does not expect any significant changes in tax benefits in the next twelve months.12.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  Rental Commitments and ContingenciesThe Company rents retail store, office and warehouse space, vehicles, and equipment under operating leases expiring at various dates through 2033. Rent expense for leases with escalations or rent holidays is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term beginning on the lease inception date. Certain leases also provide for contingent rents, which are generally determined as a percent of sales in excess of specified levels.

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION The Company has three reportable operating segments based on the geographic nature of our operations: Americas, Asia Pacific, and Europe. In addition, the 'Other businesses' category aggregates insignificant operating segments that do not meet the reportable segment threshold, including manufacturing operations located in Mexico and Italy, and corporate operations.Each of the reportable operating segments derives its revenues from the sale of footwear and accessories to external customers. Revenues for 'Other businesses' include non-footwear product sales to external customers that are excluded from the measurement of segment operating revenues and income.Segment performance is evaluated based on segment results without allocating corporate expenses, or indirect general, administrative, and other expenses. Segment profits or losses include adjustments to eliminate inter-segment sales. As such, reconciling items for segment operating income represent unallocated corporate and other expenses as well as inter-segment eliminations. The following tables set forth information related to reportable operating segments: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands)Revenues:   Americas$117,722 $124,130Asia Pacific (1)98,344 104,502Europe51,651 50,336Total segment revenues267,717 278,968Other businesses190 172Total consolidated revenues$267,907 $279,140Operating income:   Americas$22,002 $16,576Asia Pacific26,726 25,851Europe12,274 6,523Total segment income from operations61,002 48,950Reconciliation of total segment income from operations to income before income taxes:   Other businesses(5,617) (6,074)Unallocated corporate and other(39,803) (28,633)Income from operations15,582 14,243Foreign currency gain (loss), net276 (1,247)Interest income150 216Interest expense(184) (243)Other income124 82Income before income taxes$15,948 $13,051Depreciation and amortization:   Americas$1,345 $1,478Asia Pacific926 1,078Europe385 780Total segment depreciation and amortization2,656 3,336Other businesses1,746 1,710Unallocated corporate and other4,044 3,549Total consolidated depreciation and amortization$8,446 $8,595_________________________________________________________________(1) In April and May 2017, we entered into agreements to transfer certain company-operated stores located in the Middle East and China to distributors.18Table of Contents15. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  The Company was subjected to an audit by U.S. Customs & Border Protection ("CBP") in respect of the period from 2006 to 2010. In October 2013, CBP issued their final audit report. In that report CBP projected that unpaid duties totaling approximately $12.4 million were due for the period under review and recommended collection of the duties due. On April 20, 2017, CBP agreed to settle the matter and accepted the Company’s previously tendered payment of $7 million. This matter is now closed. The settlement has been reflected in the Company’s condensed financial statements as of March 31, 2017. The Company was subjected to an audit by the Brazilian Federal Tax Authorities related to imports of footwear from China between 2010 and 2014. On January 13, 2015, the Company was notified about the issuance of assessments totaling approximately $4.6 million for the period January 2010 through May 2011. The Company has disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to the claims. On February 25, 2015, the Company received additional assessments totaling approximately $10.6 million related to the remainder of the audit period. The Company has also disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to these claims in administrative appeals, and is awaiting definitive resolution of those administrative appeals. In the event that the definitive resolution of these administrative appeals is adverse to the Company, the Company has recourse to further judicial processes, which would likely require the posting of a bond. It is anticipated that this matter will take up to two years to be fully resolved. It is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of this matter or to estimate a potential amount of loss, if any.For all other claims and other disputes, where the Company is able to estimate possible losses or a range of possible losses, the Company estimates that as of March 31, 2017, it is reasonably possible that losses associated with these claims and other disputes could potentially exceed amounts accrued by the Company by up to $0.4 million, which is reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheet in 'Accrued expenses and other liabilities'.The Company is subject to other litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including employment, intellectual property and product liability claims. The Company is not party to any other pending legal proceedings that it believes would reasonably have a material adverse impact on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.19Table of ContentsITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview Crocs, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company,” “Crocs,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) are engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, worldwide marketing, distribution and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children. The broad appeal of our footwear has allowed us to market our products through a wide range of distribution channels, our own Crocs single-branded stores including both full price and outlet stores, our own e-commerce sites, traditional multi-branded stores including family footwear stores, sporting goods stores and a variety of specialty and independent retail channels, and third-party e-commerce sites. In select markets we also sell to distributors that are typically granted the rights to distribute our products in a given geographical area. Known or Anticipated TrendsBased on our recent operating results and current perspectives on our operating environment, we anticipate certain trends to impact our operating results:•Softening of the global economy and a cautious retail environment may continue to negatively affect customer purchasing trends.  •Foreign exchange rates may continue to unfavorably impact revenues from our foreign operations for the foreseeable future. •Consumers spending preferences continue to shift toward e-commerce and away from brick and mortar stores. This has resulted in continued sales growth in our e-commerce channel, which has been largely offset by declining foot traffic in our retail locations.•We anticipate lower retail revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses as we close less productive stores as leases expire and transfer select company operated stores to distributors. Distributor revenues are reported within our wholesale channel.•We have identified reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) in the amount of $75 to $85 million. These actions are projected to generate an annual $30 to $35 million improvement in earnings before interest and taxes by 2019. We expect to achieve approximately $25 million of these SG&A reductions in 2017. We expect to incur charges of approximately $10 to $15 million over the next two years to achieve these SG&A reductions, with approximately $7 to $10 million of that being incurred in 2017. In conjunction with these actions, we anticipate closing approximately 160 company operated retail stores by the end of 2018, thereby reducing our total store count to approximately 400 from 558 at the end of 2016. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), we present certain information related to our current period results of operations through “constant currency”, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed as a supplement to our results of operations and presentation of reportable segments under U.S. GAAP. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using prior year average foreign exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management uses constant currency to assist in comparing business trends from period to period on a consistent non-GAAP basis in communications with the Board of Directors (the “Board”), stockholders, analysts, and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe constant currency is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements as an additional tool to evaluate operating performance. We believe it also provides a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our operations. Investors should not consider constant currency in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.20Table of Contents Financial Highlights The following are significant developments in our businesses during the three months ended March 31, 2017:•Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $267.9 million, a decrease of $11.2 million, or 4.0%, compared to the same period in 2016. •Cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $134.3 million, a decrease of $15.5 million, or 10.3%, compared to the same period in 2016. •Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $133.6 million, an increase of $4.2 million, or 3.3%. Gross margin increased 350 basis points to 49.9%, compared to the same period in 2016. •Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $2.9 million, or 2.5%, including $2.2 million in strategic consulting and reorganization costs, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.•Net income attributable to common stockholders increased $0.8 million to income of $7.2 million compared to $6.4 million for the same period in 2016. Net earnings per common share (“EPS”) was $0.08 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $0.07 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Future Outlook We intend to continue our strategic plans for long-term improvement and growth of the business, which comprise these key initiatives: (1)   developing powerful product stories supported with effective marketing,(2)   driving global cohesive brand positioning,(3)   increasing working marketing spend,(4)   enhancing engagement with key wholesale accounts,(5)   gaining greater strategic and economic leverage from our direct-to-consumer assets,(6)   prioritizing investment in larger-scale geographies,(7)   streamlining our cost structure by reducing duplication and complexity across regional offices and the corporate center, and(8)   investing to drive supply chain effectiveness and reliability.We believe these initiatives will better position Crocs to adapt to changing customer demands and global economic developments. We are focusing on our core molded footwear heritage by narrowing our product line with an emphasis on higher margin units, as well as developing innovative new casual lifestyle footwear platforms. By streamlining the product portfolio and reducing non-core product development, we believe we will create a more powerful consumer connection to the brand. We are refining our business model around the world, prioritizing direct investment in larger-scale geographies to focus our resources on the demographics with the largest growth prospects, moving away from direct investment in the retail and wholesale businesses in smaller markets and transferring significant commercial responsibilities to distributors and third-party agents. Further, we intend to expand our engagement with leading wholesale accounts in select markets to drive sales growth, optimize product placement and enhance brand reputation.21Table of ContentsResults of OperationsComparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016  Three Months Ended March 31,     2017 2016 Change (in thousands, except per share data and average selling price)Revenues$267,907 $279,140 $(11,233) (4.0)%Cost of sales134,323 149,774 (15,451) (10.3)%Gross profit133,584 129,366 4,218 3.3 %Selling, general and administrative expenses118,002 115,123 2,879 2.5 %Income from operations15,582 14,243 1,339 9.4 %Foreign currency gain (loss), net276 (1,247) 1,523 122.1 %Interest income150 216 (66) (30.6)%Interest expense(184) (243) 59 (24.3)%Other income, net124 82 42 51.2 %Income before income taxes15,948 13,051 2,897 22.2 %Income tax expense(4,938) (2,905) (2,033) 70.0 %Net income11,010 10,146 864 8.5 %Dividends on Series A convertible preferred stock(3,000) (3,000) — — %Dividend equivalents on Series A convertible preferred shares related to redemption value accretion and beneficial conversion feature(855) (785) (70) 8.9 %Net income attributable to common stockholders$7,155 $6,361 $794 12.5 %        Net income per common share:       Basic$0.08 $0.07 $0.01 14.3 %Diluted$0.08 $0.07 $0.01 14.3 %        Gross margin49.9% 46.3% 350 7.6 %Operating margin5.8% 5.1% 70 13.7 %Footwear unit sales16,396 16,268 128 0.8 %Average footwear selling price$16.11 $16.85 $(0.74) (4.4)%Revenues. Revenues decreased $11.2 million, or 4.0%, in the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in revenues was due to the net effect of: (i) an increase of $2.2 million, or 0.8%, due to higher unit sales volumes, (ii) a decrease of $14.3 million, or 5.1%, due to lower average selling prices, and (iii) an increase of $0.9 million, or 0.3%, from foreign currency translation.Cost of sales. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, cost of sales decreased $15.5 million, or 10.3%, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in cost of sales was due to the net impact of: (i) an increase of $1.2 million, or 0.8%, due to higher unit sales volumes, (ii) a decrease of $18.5 million, or 12.3%, due to lower average costs per unit, and (iii) an increase of $1.8 million, or 1.2%, from foreign currency translation. Lower average costs per unit were primarily the result of product mix, including sandals and clog silhouettes which cost less to produce, and lower negotiated inbound ocean freight costs. Gross profit. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, gross profit increased $4.2 million, or 3.3%, and gross margin increased 350 basis points to 49.9% compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in gross profit is due to the net impact of: (i) an increase of $4.1 million, or 3.2%, due to the combined impact of decreases in average costs per unit which exceeded decreases in average selling prices, (ii) an increase of $1.0 million, or 0.8%, due to higher sales unit volumes, and (iii) a decrease of $0.9 million, or 0.7%, from foreign currency translation. 22Table of ContentsSelling, general and administrative expenses. SG&A increased $2.9 million, or 2.5%, during the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to the combined impact of: (i) an increase of $3.8 million in marketing expense related to our 2017 spring and summer advertising and promotional activities; (ii) increases in other expenses of $0.9 million, none of which were individually significant; offset by (iii) cash recoveries of previously reserved accounts receivable of $1.1 million; and (iv) lower SG&A related to the disposition of our Taiwan and South Africa businesses of $0.7 million. Bad debt expense related to our China operations was not significant during 2017 or 2016, due to the implementation of a more restrictive credit policy in 2015 and continued focus on the creditworthiness of our distribution partners.Foreign currency gain (loss), net. ‘Foreign currency gain (loss), net’ consists of foreign currency gains and losses from the re-measurement and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies, and realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivative instruments. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains of $0.3 million compared to net losses of $1.2 million on foreign currency during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Income tax expense. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, income tax expense increased $2.0 million compared to the same period in 2016. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was 31.0% compared to an effective tax rate of 22.1% for the same period in 2016, an 8.9% increase. The increase in the effective rate was driven primarily by operating losses in certain jurisdictions where we are unable to record tax benefits because we have determined that it is not more likely than not that such tax benefits will be realized, as well as an increase in profitability in certain jurisdictions for which tax expense is recorded. Our effective tax rate of 31.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate primarily due to differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions as well as book losses in certain jurisdictions for which tax benefits cannot be recognized.Revenues by Channel Three Months EndedMarch 31, Change Constant Currency Change (1) 2017 2016 $ % $ % (in thousands)Wholesale:           Americas$71,023 $74,155 $(3,132) (4.2)% $(4,279) (5.8)%Asia Pacific70,935 77,154 (6,219) (8.1)% (6,220) (8.1)%Europe40,583 39,062 1,521 3.9 % 2,137 5.5 %Other businesses190 172 18 10.5 % 21 12.2 %Total wholesale182,731 190,543 (7,812) (4.1)% (8,341) (4.4)%Retail:           Americas32,829 35,749 (2,920) (8.2)% (2,958) (8.3)%Asia Pacific21,532 22,519 (987) (4.4)% (1,164) (5.2)%Europe7,419 7,555 (136) (1.8)% (411) (5.4)%Total retail61,780 65,823 (4,043) (6.1)% (4,533) (6.9)%E-commerce:           Americas13,869 14,226 (357) (2.5)% (392) (2.8)%Asia Pacific5,877 4,829 1,048 21.7 % 1,103 22.8 %Europe3,650 3,719 (69) (1.9)% (32) (0.9)%Total e-commerce23,396 22,774 622 2.7 % 679 3.0 %Total revenues$267,907 $279,140 $(11,233) (4.0)% $(12,195) (4.4)%_________________________________________________________________(1) Reflects year over year change as if the current period results were in “constant currency”, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. “Constant currency” represents current period results that have been retranslated using exchange rates used in the prior comparative period.23Table of ContentsWholesale channel revenues. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, revenues from our wholesale channel decreased $7.8 million, or 4.1%, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in wholesale channel revenues was due to the net impact of: (i) an increase of $2.2 million, or 1.1%, in unit sales volumes, (ii) a decrease of $10.5 million, or 5.5%, due to lower average selling prices, and (iii) an increase of $0.5 million, or 0.3%, from foreign currency translation. Retail channel revenues. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, revenues from our retail channel decreased $4.0 million, or 6.1%, compared to the same period in 2016.

During the three months ended March 31, 2017, revenues from our e-commerce channel increased $0.6 million, or 2.7%, compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in e-commerce revenues was due to the net impact of: (i) an increase of $2.4 million, or 10.5%, in unit sales volumes (primarily due to increased sales volumes in the Americas and Asia Pacific segments), (ii) a decrease of $1.7 million, or 7.5%, due to lower average selling prices, and (iii) a decrease of $0.1 million, or 0.3%, from foreign currency translation.Future changes in average selling prices will be impacted by: (i) the mix of products sold, (ii) the sales channel under which the sales are made (as we generally realize higher sales prices from our retail and e-commerce channels as compared to our wholesale channel), and (iii) the level of sales discounts and incentives we offer our customers.Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 by Reportable Operating SegmentThe following table sets forth information related to our reportable operating segments, including a comparison of revenues and operating income by segment: Three Months Ended March 31, Change Constant CurrencyChange (1) 2017 2016 $ % $ % (in thousands)Revenues:           Americas$117,722 $124,130 $(6,408) (5.2)% $(7,629) (6.1)%Asia Pacific98,344 104,502 (6,158) (5.9)% (6,281) (6.0)%Europe51,651 50,336 1,315 2.6 % 1,694 3.4 %Total segment revenues267,717 278,968 (11,251) (4.0)% (12,216) (4.4)%Other businesses190 172 18 10.5 % 21 12.2 %Total revenues$267,907 $279,140 $(11,233) (4.0)% $(12,195) (4.4)%            Income from operations: (2)           Americas$22,002 $16,576 $5,426 32.7 % $5,306 32.0 %Asia Pacific26,726 25,851 875 3.4 % 816 3.2 %Europe12,274 6,523 5,751 88.2 % 5,835 89.5 %Total segment operating income61,002 48,950 12,052 24.6 % 11,957 24.4 %Other businesses (3)(5,617) (6,074) 457 (7.5)% 423 (7.0)%Unallocated corporate and other (4)(39,803) (28,633) (11,170) 39.0 % (11,238) 39.2 %Total operating income$15,582 $14,243 $1,339 9.4 % $1,142 8.0 %_________________________________________________________________(1) Reflects year over year change as if the current period results were in “constant currency”, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. “Constant currency” represents current period results that have been retranslated using exchange rates used in the prior comparative period.(2) Income from operations in the Americas increased primarily as a result of lower product costs. Income from operations in Asia increased as a result of both lower product costs and lower selling, general and administrative expenses.

Temporarily closed stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation during the month of closure. Location closures in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month post re-opening. E-commerce revenues are based on same site sales period over period.27Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesWe anticipate our cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility (as described below) will be sufficient to meet the ongoing liquidity needs of our business for the next twelve months. As of March 31, 2017, we had $88.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and up to $75.2 million in available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. At March 31, 2017, $83.5 million of our $88.9 million in cash and cash equivalents was held in international locations. See “Repatriation of Cash” below for more information. Additional future financing may be necessary to fund our operations and there can be no assurance that, if needed, we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change (in thousands)Cash used in operating activities$(49,890) $(56,938) $7,048Cash used in investing activities(6,248) (7,690) 1,442Cash provided by (used in) financing activities(1,116) 4,000 (5,116)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash(1,427) 6,367 (7,794)Net change in cash and cash equivalents$(58,681) $(54,261) $(4,420) Operating Activities. Cash used in operating activities decreased $7.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in cash used in operating activities resulted from a favorable change in net income as adjusted for non-cash items of $5.5 million, and a favorable change in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million. Net income as adjusted for non-cash items increased primarily due to: (i) an increase of $6.5 million from net unrealized foreign currency forward contracts gains and losses, (ii) an increase of $0.9 million from higher net income, (iii) a decrease of $1.0 million in bad debts, and (iv) a decrease of $0.9 million in other non-cash items. The net increase from operating assets and liabilities was due to: (i) an increase of $2.8 million from accounts receivable, (ii) a decrease of $14.2 million from inventory largely driven by inventory management initiatives, (iii) an increase of $16.4 million in prepaids and other expenses driven primarily by our advertising and promotional expenditures and a customs duty settlement, and (iv) a decrease of $3.4 million from lower accounts payable and accrued expenses.Investing Activities. The $1.4 million decrease in cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 is primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $0.9 million decrease in long-term restricted cash, and (ii) a $0.5 million decrease in cash paid for intangible assets during the prior comparative three months ended March 31, 2016. Our capital expenditures in the three months ended March 31, 2017 did not change significantly compared to the same period in 2016.Financing Activities. The $5.1 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 resulted from lower borrowings and repayments during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Our net borrowings decreased because we financed more of our short-term cash requirements from internal cash generated from operations.Working Capital. Changes in cash from working capital during the three months ended March 31, 2017 were due primarily to the following: (i) higher accounts receivable of $66.9 million, primarily due to the higher seasonal sales volumes in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of last year, (ii) higher inventories of $28.6 million in advance of our spring and summer selling seasons, (iii) lower prepaid expenses and other assets of $9.6 million due primarily to a customs duty settlement of $7.0 million and amortization of prepaid advertising, endorsement and other prepaids of $2.6 million, and (iv) higher accounts payable, accrued expenses and other of $13.8 million, primarily related to increased inventory levels in advance of our spring and summer selling seasons. Cash on hand decreased $58.7 million as of March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.Bad debt expense related to our China operations was not significant during 2017 or 2016, due to the implementation of a more restrictive credit policy in 2015 and continued focus on the creditworthiness of our distribution partners.28Table of ContentsSenior Revolving Credit FacilityIn order to provide additional liquidity in the future and to help support our strategic goals, our Senior Revolving Credit Facility (the "Facility"), as amended, provides for borrowings of up to $80.0 million through February 2021. The Facility contains financial covenants that restrict certain actions by us, including limitations on: (i) stock repurchases to $50.0 million per year, subject to certain restrictions; and (ii) capital expenditures and commitments to $50.0 million per year. The Facility also requires us to meet certain financial covenant ratios that become effective when total borrowings, including letters of credit, exceed $20.0 million during certain periods or when the outstanding borrowings exceed the borrowing base. If the financial covenants are in effect, we must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings as of March 31, 2017 was 3.54%. As of March 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants.As of March 31, 2017, we had borrowings of $3.5 million on the Facility and $1.3 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in $75.2 million of available credit for future financing needs.Long-term Bank BorrowingsAs of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had $0.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of current debt outstanding under notes payable. As of March 31, 2017, the notes bear interest rates ranging from 1.99% to 2.63%.Stock Repurchase Plan Authorizations On December 26, 2013, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $350.0 million of our common stock. The number, price, structure, and timing of the repurchases will be at our sole discretion and may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and does not oblige us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. The Board may suspend, modify, or terminate the repurchase program at any time without prior notice. As of March 31, 2017, we had $118.7 million of remaining common stock repurchase authorizations under our 2013 stock repurchase plan. During each of the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no repurchases. Capital Assets Expenditures During the three months ended March 31, 2017, net capital assets acquired, inclusive of intangible assets, were $5.4 million compared to $5.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2017, we have committed to additional purchases of capital assets of approximately $9.7 million. Capital spend during the three months ended March 31, 2017 related primarily to information technology investments, opening new retail stores and renovating existing stores. Repatriation of Cash We have cash balances located in various countries and denominations associated with our international operations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact the results of our operations and cash positions. Future fluctuations in foreign currencies may have a material impact on our cash flows and capital resources. Cash balances held in foreign countries may have additional restrictions and covenants that could adversely impact our liquidity and our ability to timely access and transfer cash balances between entities.We generally consider unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. to be indefinitely reinvested; however, our Board has approved a foreign cash repatriation strategy. As part of this strategy, we repatriated approximately $13.4 million of current earnings during the three months ended March 31, 2017 without a tax impact. Further cash repatriation will depend on future cash requirements in the U.S. As of March 31, 2017, we maintain approximately $178.0 million of foreign earnings for which tax has previously been provided that has not yet been repatriated.29Table of ContentsMost of the cash balances held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S., but under current law, would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. In some countries, repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws and could have adverse tax consequences if we were to move the cash to another country. Certain countries have monetary laws, which may limit our ability to utilize cash resources in those countries for operations in other countries. These limitations may affect our ability to fully utilize our cash resources for needs in the U.S. or other countries and could adversely affect our liquidity. As of March 31, 2017, we held $83.5 million of our total $88.9 million cash balance in international locations. This cash is primarily used for the ongoing operations of the business in the locations in which the cash is held. Of the $83.5 million, $1.1 million could potentially be restricted, as described above. If the remaining $82.4 million were immediately repatriated to the U.S., no additional tax expense would be incurred as $178.0 million has previously been provided for in prior periods.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies or their application since December 31, 2016.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, and issued accounting pronouncements that we believe may have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when adopted.30Table of ContentsITEM 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskForeign Currency Exchange RiskAs a global company, we have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. We are exposed to the risk of gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities within our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary’s functional currency. Likewise, our U.S. companies are also exposed to the risk of gains and losses and the resulting changes in exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar.We have experienced and will continue to experience changes in international currency rates, impacting both results of operations and the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to buy or sell various foreign currencies to selectively protect against volatility in the value of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings in the period that the changes occur. As of March 31, 2017, the U.S. Dollar notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts was approximately $259.2 million. The net fair value of these contracts at March 31, 2017 was a liability $1.3 million. We perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts. To perform the sensitivity analysis, we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by the foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the U.S. Dollar. As of March 31, 2017, a 10% appreciation in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a net increase in the fair value of our derivative portfolio of approximately $5.9 million.Effects of Changes in Exchange Rates on Translated Results of International Subsidiaries Changes in exchange rates have a direct effect on our reported U.S. Dollar consolidated financial statements because we translate the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries to U.S. Dollars using current period exchange rates. Specifically, we translate the statements of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into the U.S. Dollar reporting currency using average exchange rates each reporting period. As a result, comparisons of reported results between reporting periods may be impacted significantly due to differences in the exchange rates used to translate the operating results of our international subsidiaries. For example, in our European operating segment, when the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to the Euro, our reported U.S. Dollar results are lower than if there had been no change in the exchange rate, because more Euros are required to generate the same U.S. Dollar translated amount. Conversely, when the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to the Euro, the reported U.S. Dollar results of our Europe segment are higher compared to a period with a stronger U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro. Similarly, the reported U.S. Dollar results of our Asia Pacific operating segment, where the functional currencies are primarily the Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, Korean Won and the Singapore Dollar, are comparatively lower or higher when the U.S. Dollar strengthens or weakens, respectively, relative to these currencies.An increase of 1% of the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies would have increased our income before taxes during the three months ended March 31, 2017 by approximately $0.3 million. The volatility of the exchange rates is dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. See Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part I of this Form 10-Q for a discussion of the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates on our U.S Dollar condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.31Table of ContentsITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such item is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2017, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures that, by their nature, can only provide reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the three months ended March 31, 2017, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.32Table of ContentsPART II — Other Information ITEM 1. Legal ProceedingsThe Company was subjected to an audit by U.S. Customs & Border Protection (“CBP”) in respect of the period from 2006 to 2010. In October 2013, CBP issued their final audit report. In that report CBP projected that unpaid duties totaling approximately $12.4 million were due for the period under review and recommended collection of the duties due. On April 2017, CBP agreed to settle the matter and accepted our previously tendered payment of $7 million. This matter is now closed. The settlement has been reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2017. We were subjected to an audit by the Brazilian Federal Tax Authorities related to imports of footwear from China between 2010 and 2014. On January 13, 2015, we were notified about the issuance of assessments totaling approximately $4.6 million for the period January 2010 through May 2011. We have disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to the claims. On February 25, 2015, we received additional assessments totaling approximately $10.6 million related to the remainder of the audit period. We have also disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to these claims in administrative appeals, and are awaiting definitive resolution of those administrative appeals. In the event that the definitive resolution of these administrative appeals is adverse to us, we have recourse to further judicial processes, which would likely require the posting of a bond. It is anticipated that this matter will take up to two years to be fully resolved. It is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of this matter.Although we are subject to other litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including employment, intellectual property and product liability claims, we are not party to any other pending legal proceedings that we believe would reasonably have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.ITEM 1A.

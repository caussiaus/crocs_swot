AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Unless otherwise noted in this report, any description of the “Company,” “Crocs,” “we,” “us,” or “our” includes Crocs, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries within our reportable operating segments and corporate operations. The Company is engaged in the design, development, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children. We strive to be the global leader in the sale of molded footwear characterized by functionality, comfort, color, and lightweight design. Our reportable operating segments include: the Americas, operating in North and South America; Asia Pacific, operating throughout Asia, Australia, and New Zealand; and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), operating throughout Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Africa. In the third quarter of 2018, certain revenues and expenses previously reported within the ‘Asia Pacific’ segment were shifted to the ‘EMEA’ segment. See Note 14 — Operating Segments and Geographic Information for additional information. The previously reported amounts for revenues and income from operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and reflect all adjustments which are necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Such unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (“Annual Report”), and have been prepared on a consistent basis with the accounting policies described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report. Our accounting policies did not change during the six months ended June 30, 2019, other than for the new accounting pronouncements adopted as described in Note 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” within Part I - Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.ReclassificationsIn addition to the shift in certain revenues and expenses previously reported within the ‘Asia Pacific’ and ‘EMEA’ segments described above, the Company has reclassified certain amounts on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows to conform to current period presentation. Seasonality of BusinessDue to the seasonal nature of our footwear, which is more heavily focused on styles suitable for warm weather, revenues generated during our fourth quarter, when the northern hemisphere is experiencing cooler weather, are typically less than revenues generated during our first three quarters. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including the timing of new model introductions, general economic conditions, and consumer confidence. Accordingly, results of operations and cash flows for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of expected results for any other quarter or for any other year.Transactions with AffiliatesThe Company receives services from three affiliates of Blackstone Capital Partners VI L.P. (“Blackstone”). Blackstone and certain of its permitted transferees beneficially owned 6,896,548 shares of the Company’s common stock as of June 30, 2019. Blackstone also has the future right to designate for nomination one director to our Board, and currently has two designees serving on the Board.7Table of ContentsCertain Blackstone affiliates provide various services to the Company, including inventory count services, cybersecurity and consulting, and workforce management services. The Company incurred expenses for services from these affiliates of $0.3 million for both of the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, and $1.0 million and $0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Expenses related to these services are reported in ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.2. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  New Accounting Pronouncement AdoptedReclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeIn February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued authoritative guidance that permits reclassification of the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act (“Tax Act”) on accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to retained earnings. This guidance may be adopted retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the income tax effects of the Tax Act related to items remaining in AOCI are recognized, or at the beginning of the period of adoption. The guidance became effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. This guidance became effective during the first quarter of 2019; however, the Company did not elect to make the optional reclassification. Our policy is to release stranded tax effects from AOCI using either a specific identification approach or portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item.LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to accounting for leases. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the guidance using the modified retrospective method applied as of the date of adoption. The comparative information presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements was not restated and is reported under the accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. The Company has elected all of the available transition practical expedients, including the ‘package of practical expedients’, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company has elected not to apply ‘hindsight’ when adopting the standard for determining the reasonably certain lease term and in assessing impairments. The Company has elected the short-term lease exemption, which means the Company has not and will not recognize a right-of-use asset or liability for leases that qualify for the short-term exemption and will recognize those lease expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term in its condensed consolidated statements of operations. Further, the Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components for all of its leases.Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and liabilities of approximately $176.1 million and $187.4 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2019, with additional adjustments to ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’, ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’, and ‘Retained earnings’. As a result of the adoption of new lease accounting standards, the Company assessed the initial right-of-use assets for impairment and recorded non-cash impairments of $0.2 million within ‘Retained earnings’ in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the condensed consolidated statements of operations or cash flows.New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedImplementation Costs Incurred in Cloud Computing ArrangementsIn August 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to the treatment of implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is considered a service contract. This guidance becomes effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those periods, with early adoption permitted, and will be applied prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. Other PronouncementsOther new pronouncements issued but not effective until after June 30, 2019 are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.8Table of Contents3.

See Note 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements for more information.(2) At December 31, 2018, includes accrued payments of $3.0 million to induce the conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of common stock.4. LEASESThe Company adopted authoritative guidance related to leases effective January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements was not restated and is reported under the accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. See ‘Leases’ in Note 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements for a discussion of the significant changes resulting from adoption of the guidance.The Company’s lease portfolio consists primarily of real estate assets, which includes retail, warehouse, distribution center, and office spaces, under operating leases expiring at various dates through 2033. Leases with an original term of twelve months or less are not reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheet; expense for these short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.Many leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that if exercised by us, extend the lease term from one to 10 years. The exercise of these renewal options is at the Company’s discretion. When assessing the likelihood of a renewal or termination, the Company considers the significance of leasehold improvements, availability of alternative locations, and the cost of relocation or replacement, among other considerations. The depreciable lives of leasehold improvements are the shorter of the useful lives of the improvements or the expected lease term. The Company determines the lease term for each lease based on the terms of each contract and factors in renewal and early termination options if such options are reasonably certain to be exercised.Due to the Company’s centralized treasury function, the Company utilizes a portfolio approach to discount its lease obligations. The Company assesses the expected lease term at lease inception and discounts the lease using a fully-secured annual incremental borrowing rate, adjusted for time value corresponding with the expected lease term. Certain of our retail store leases include rental payments based upon a percentage of retail sales in excess of a minimum fixed rental. In some cases, there is no fixed minimum rental and the entire rental payment is based upon a percentage of sales. Certain of our warehouse leases have rental payments that vary based upon the volume of product placed in storage. In addition, certain leases include rental payments adjusted periodically for changes in price level indexes. We recognize expense for these types of payments as incurred and report them as variable lease expense.9Table of ContentsRight-of-Use Assets and Operating Lease LiabilitiesAmounts reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheet were: June 30, 2019 (in thousands)Assets: Right-of-use assets$163,808Liabilities: Current operating lease liabilities$45,394Long-term operating lease liabilities124,329Total operating lease liabilities$169,723Lease Costs and Other InformationLease-related costs reported in the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of operations were: Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 (in thousands)Operating lease cost $14,749 $29,679Short-term lease cost387 1,747Variable lease cost4,300 7,289Total lease costs$19,436 $38,715Other information related to leases, including supplemental cash flow information, consists of: Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 (in thousands)Cash paid for operating leases$33,729Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities (1)190,102(1) Includes $176.1 million for operating leases existing on January 1, 2019 and $14.0 million for operating leases that commenced in the six months ended June 30, 2019.  As ofJune 30, 2019Weighted average remaining lease term (in years)5.5Weighted average discount rate4.8%10Table of ContentsMaturitiesThe maturities of the Company’s operating lease liabilities were: As ofJune 30, 2019 (in thousands)2019 (remainder of year)$23,614202047,412202139,420202226,607202318,391Thereafter41,095Total future minimum lease payments196,539Less: imputed interest(26,816)Total operating lease liabilities$169,723Leases That Have Not Yet Commenced As of June 30, 2019, we had significant obligations for leases that have not yet commenced related to our new distribution center and office relocation projects. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a new distribution center in Dayton, Ohio, which is expected to fully replace the Company’s existing facility in Ontario, California by the end of 2019. The contractual commitment related to this lease, with payments beginning at substantial completion of the building and continuing through 2030, is approximately $25.4 million, with expected total capital investments of approximately $35 million. In the first quarter of 2019, the Company entered into a lease for its new corporate headquarters and regional office in Broomfield, Colorado. The contractual commitment related to this lease, with payments beginning in March 2020 and continuing through August 2030, is approximately $20.4 million, with expected net capital investments totaling $7.0 million.Comparative Information as Reported Under Previous Accounting StandardsThe following comparative information is reported based upon previous accounting standards in effect for the periods presented.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  Recurring Fair Value Measurements All of the Company’s derivative instruments are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and are reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets within ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments were liabilities of $0.5 million and $1.3 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. See Note 6 — Derivative Financial Instruments for more information.The carrying amounts of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and current accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate their fair value as recorded due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.The Company’s borrowing instruments are recorded at their carrying values in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, which may differ from their respective fair values. The fair values of the Company’s outstanding borrowings approximate their carrying values at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, based on interest rates currently available to the Company for similar borrowings and were: June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value (in thousands)Borrowings$215,000 $215,000 $120,000 $120,000Non-Financial Assets and LiabilitiesThe Company’s non-financial assets, which primarily consist of property and equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets, are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying value. The fair values of these assets are determined based on Level 3 measurements, including estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows based upon historical experience, expected market conditions, and management’s plans. Impairment expense is reported in ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company did not record impairment expense in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded non-cash impairment expenses of $0.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, to reduce the carrying values of certain retail store assets. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded non-cash impairment expenses of $0.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, to reduce the carrying values of certain supply chain assets, included in ‘Other businesses,’ to their estimated fair values.6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  The Company transacts business in various foreign countries and is therefore exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk that impacts the reported U.S. Dollar amounts of revenues, expenses, and certain foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. In order to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency and to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company enters into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currency. By policy, the Company does not enter into these contracts for trading purposes or speculation. 12Table of ContentsCounterparty default risk is considered low because the forward contracts that the Company enters into are over-the-counter instruments transacted with highly-rated financial institutions. The Company was not required to and did not post collateral as of June 30, 2019 or December 31, 2018.The Company’s derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES AND BANK BORROWINGS  The Company’s borrowings were as follows: June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 (in thousands)Revolving credit facilities$215,000 $120,000Less: Current portion of borrowings— —Total long-term borrowings$215,000 $120,000Senior Revolving Credit FacilityIn December 2011, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility (the “Facility”), pursuant to an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), with the lenders named therein and PNC Bank, National Association, as a lender and administrative agent for the lenders. The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict certain actions by the Company, including limitations on: (i) stock repurchases to an aggregate of $250.0 million per fiscal year, subject to certain restrictions; and (ii) capital expenditures and commitments to $70.0 million per year. The Credit Agreement also permits intercompany loans of up to $375.0 million and requires the Company to meet certain financial covenant ratios that become effective when average outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, including letters of credit, exceed the lesser of $40.0 million or 40% of the total commitments during certain periods or if the outstanding borrowings exceed the borrowing base. If the financial covenant ratios are in effect, the Company must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of (i) 2.75 to 1.00 at June 30, 2019, (ii) 2.50 to 1.00 at September 30, 2019, and the last day of each quarter thereafter. As of June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.As of June 30, 2019, the total commitments available from the lenders under the Facility were $300.0 million. At June 30, 2019, the Company had $215.0 million in outstanding borrowings, which are due in February 2021, and $4.6 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Facility, which reduces amounts available for borrowing under the Facility. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had $80.4 million and $129.4 million, respectively, of available borrowing capacity under the Facility.The Company also has a revolving credit facility in Asia, under which the Company had no borrowings during the six months ended June 30, 2019 and year ended December 31, 2018 or borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.Amended Senior Revolving Credit FacilityOn July 26, 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (the “Borrowers”) entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Restated Credit Agreement”) with the lenders named therein and PNC Bank, National Association, as a lender and administrative agent. The Restated Credit Agreement replaces the Credit Agreement described above.The Restated Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $450.0 million, which can be increased by an additional $150.0 million subject to certain conditions, and the Restated Credit Agreement will mature on July 26, 2024. Borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate based on a domestic base rate or a LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.875% based on the Company’s leverage ratio.Among other things, the Restated Credit Agreement amended the prior Credit Agreement to (i) require the Company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 4.00 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 from September 30, 2019 to September 30, 2020, decreasing to 3.25 to 1.00 from December 31, 2020 and thereafter (subject to an increase to 4.00 to 1.00 in the event of certain permitted acquisitions or stock repurchases); (ii) allow stock repurchases so long as after giving effect to such stock repurchases, the maximum leverage ratio does not exceed the applicable maximum leverage ratio, less 0.25; (iii) allow permitted acquisitions so long as there is borrowing availability under the Restated Credit Agreement of at least $40.0 million; and (iv) amend certain other covenants and provisions to be more favorable to the Borrowers. Except as described above, the other material terms of the Restated Credit Agreement are substantially the same as the prior Credit Agreement.Borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement are secured by all of the assets of the Borrowers, and guaranteed by certain other subsidiaries of the Borrowers. 14Table of Contents8.

As of June 30, 2019, unrecognized share-based compensation expenses for service-condition awards were $10.9 million and for performance- and market-condition awards were $8.7 million, and are expected to amortize over remaining weighted average periods of 1.7 years and 2.1 years, respectively.11. INCOME TAXES Income tax expense and effective tax rates were: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 (in thousands, except effective tax rate)Income before income taxes$44,676 $37,377 $75,005 $64,589Income tax expense5,478 3,000 11,097 13,758Effective tax rate12.3% 8.0% 14.8% 21.3%During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the increase in the effective tax rate, compared to the same period in 2018, was driven primarily by tax expense recorded in profitable jurisdictions, partially offset by operating losses in jurisdictions for which the Company has determined it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits and the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions. The Company’s effective income tax rate, for each period presented, also differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate primarily due to differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, as well as operating losses in certain jurisdictions for which tax benefits cannot be recognized. There were no significant or unusual discrete tax items during the six months ended June 30, 2019. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $4.4 million and $4.5 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and the Company does not expect any significant changes in tax benefits in the next twelve months.During the six months ended June 30, 2019, income tax expense decreased $2.7 million compared to the same period in 2018. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was 14.8% compared to an effective tax rate of 21.3% for the same period in 2018, a 6.5% decrease. This decrease in the effective rate was due to operating losses in jurisdictions for which the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits, partially offset by tax expense recorded in profitable jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate of 14.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate due to differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions as well as book losses in certain jurisdictions for which tax benefits cannot be recognized.Our tax rate is volatile and may increase or decrease with changes in, among other things, the amount of income or loss by jurisdiction, our ability to utilize net operating losses and foreign tax credits, changes in tax laws, and the movement of liabilities established pursuant to accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions as statutes of limitations expire, positions are effectively settled, or when additional information becomes available. There are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions and other changes to regulatory environments in countries in which we do business that, if enacted, may have an impact on our effective tax rate.18Table of Contents12.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, 0.1 million and 0.2 million options and RSUs were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS under the two-class method because the effect was anti-dilutive.13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Purchase CommitmentsAs of June 30, 2019, the Company had purchase commitments to third-party manufacturers, primarily for materials and supplies used in the manufacture of the Company’s products, for an aggregate of $109.3 million.OtherThe Company is regularly subject to, and is currently undergoing, audits by various tax authorities in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions, including customs duties, import, and other taxes for prior tax years. During its normal course of business, the Company may make certain indemnities, commitments, and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments. The Company cannot determine a range of estimated future payments and has not recorded any liability for indemnities, commitments, and guarantees in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.See Note 15 — Legal Proceedings for further details regarding potential loss contingencies related to government tax audits and other current legal proceedings.19Table of Contents14. OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION The Company has three reportable operating segments based on the geographic nature of its operations: Americas, Asia Pacific, and EMEA. In addition, the ‘Other businesses’ category aggregates insignificant operating segments that do not meet the reportable segment threshold, including corporate operations and company-operated manufacturing facilities, which substantially ceased operations in the third quarter of 2018.Each of the reportable operating segments derives its revenues from the sale of footwear and accessories to external customers. Revenues for ‘Other businesses’ include non-footwear and accessories product sales to external customers that are excluded from the measurement of segment operating revenues and income. Segment performance is evaluated based on segment results without allocating corporate expenses, or indirect general, administrative, and other expenses. Segment profits or losses include adjustments to eliminate inter-segment sales. Reconciling items between segment income from operations and income from operations consist of other businesses and unallocated corporate and other expenses, as well as inter-segment eliminations. The following tables set forth information related to reportable operating segments: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 (in thousands)Revenues:       Americas$170,440 $137,762 $299,566 $261,592Asia Pacific (1)118,424 122,303 209,471 213,482EMEA (1)69,961 67,644 145,685 135,470Total segment revenues358,825 327,709 654,722 610,544Other businesses74 295 126 608Total consolidated revenues$358,899 $328,004 $654,848 $611,152Income from operations:       Americas$56,945 $39,689 $90,554 $68,228Asia Pacific (1)28,083 33,672 54,764 57,780EMEA (1)22,533 21,416 47,577 41,755Total segment income from operations107,561 94,777 192,895 167,763Reconciliation of total segment income from operations to income before income taxes:       Other businesses(10,133) (16,531) (26,470) (27,465)Unallocated corporate and other (2)(49,597) (41,182) (86,016) (77,312)Income from operations47,831 37,064 80,409 62,986Foreign currency gains (losses), net(261) 283 (1,478) 1,354Interest income131 146 326 425Interest expense(2,421) (132) (4,238) (245)Other income(604) 16 (14) 69Income before income taxes$44,676 $37,377 $75,005 $64,589        Depreciation and amortization:       Americas$869 $1,211 $1,778 $2,515Asia Pacific208 537 432 1,233EMEA194 327 415 679Total segment depreciation and amortization1,271 2,075 2,625 4,427Other businesses1,058 1,431 2,381 2,955Unallocated corporate and other3,400 3,725 6,859 7,492Total consolidated depreciation and amortization$5,729 $7,231 $11,865 $14,874(1) In the third quarter of 2018, certain revenues and expenses previously reported within the ‘Asia Pacific’ segment were shifted to the ‘EMEA’ segment.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company was subjected to an audit by the Brazilian Federal Tax Authorities related to imports of footwear from China between 2010 and 2014. On January 13, 2015, the Company was notified about the issuance of assessments totaling 14.4 million Brazilian Real (“BRL”), or approximately $3.7 million, plus interest and penalties, for the period January 2010 through May 2011. The Company has disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to the claims. On February 25, 2015, the Company received additional assessments totaling 33.3 million BRL, or approximately $8.6 million, plus interest and penalties, related to the remainder of the audit period. The Company has also disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to these claims in administrative appeals. On August 29, 2017, the Company received a favorable ruling on its appeal of the first assessment, which dismissed all fines, penalties, and interest. The tax authorities have appealed that decision and Crocs has challenged the appeal on both the merits and procedure. Should the Brazilian Tax Authority prevail in this final administrative appeal, Crocs may still challenge the assessments through the court system, which would likely require the posting of a bond. Additionally, the second appeal for the remaining assessments was heard on March 22, 2018. That decision was partially favorable and resulted in an approximately 38% reduction in principal, penalties, and interest, leaving approximately $5.3 million, plus interest and penalties, at risk for those assessments. The tax authorities have appealed that decision and Crocs has filed a response to the tax authorities’ appeal as well as a separate appeal against the unfavorable portion of the ruling. We have not recorded these items within the condensed consolidated financial statements as it is not possible at this time to predict the timing or outcome of this matter or to estimate a potential amount of loss, if any.For all other claims and disputes, where the Company is able to estimate reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses, the Company estimates that as of June 30, 2019, reasonably possible losses associated with these claims and other disputes could potentially exceed amounts accrued by up to $0.6 million.Although the Company is subject to other litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including employment, intellectual property and product liability claims, the Company is not party to any other pending legal proceedings that it believes would reasonably have a material adverse impact on its business, financial results, and cash flows.22Table of ContentsITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business OverviewCrocs, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively the “Company,” “Crocs,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) are engaged in the design, development, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children.

Known or Anticipated TrendsBased on our recent operating results and current perspectives on our operating environment, we anticipate certain trends will continue to impact our operating results:•Consumer spending preferences continue to shift toward e-commerce and away from brick and mortar stores. This has resulted in continued sales growth in our e-commerce channel, as well as with various e-tail partners in the wholesale channel.•We continue to place greater priority on outlet stores, so that they now represent 51.9% of our store base.•A cautious purchasing environment may negatively affect customer purchasing trends. •Foreign exchange rate volatility impacts our reported U.S. Dollar results from our foreign operations.•In 2018, we successfully completed our SG&A reduction plan, eliminating approximately $75 million of annualized expenses from our cost structure. We are on track to realize approximately $10 million in additional cost reductions in 2019. We intend to reinvest some of those savings in marketing and our e-commerce business, to further strengthen our brand and drive incremental sales growth.•As a result of the repurchase and conversion of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on December 5, 2018, we are no longer required to pay $12 million annually in preferred stock dividends.•Non-recurring charges relating to the Company’s new distribution center in Dayton, Ohio are expected to reduce gross margin by approximately 100 basis points in 2019. In 2020 and beyond, when the new distribution center is fully operational, we expect a benefit to gross margin of approximately 100 basis points in addition to the 100 basis point benefit associated with the 2019 non-recurring charges not being repeated. •Capital expenditures to support our growth are expected to be approximately $65 million in 2019.Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), we present certain information related to our results of operations through “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed as a supplement to our results of operations and presentation of reportable segments under U.S. GAAP. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using prior year average foreign exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on reported amounts. Management uses constant currency to assist in comparing business trends from period to period on a consistent basis in communications with the Board, stockholders, analysts, and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe constant currency is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements as an additional tool to evaluate operating performance and trends. Investors should not consider constant currency in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.23Table of ContentsSecond Quarter 2019 Financial and Operational HighlightsRevenues were $358.9 million for the second quarter of 2019, a 9.4% increase compared to the second quarter of 2018. The increase was due to the net effects of: (i) higher average selling prices as we increased pricing and reduced promotional discounting, which increased revenues by $26.0 million, or 7.9%; (ii) higher unit sales volumes, which increased revenues by $14.8 million, or 4.5%; and (iii) unfavorable changes in exchange rates, which decreased revenues by $9.9 million, or 3.0%The following were significant developments affecting our businesses and capital structure during the three months ended June 30, 2019:•We sold 19.0 million pairs of shoes worldwide, an increase of 6.7% from 17.8 million pairs in the three months ended June 30, 2018.•Gross margin was 52.8%, a decline of 250 basis points from last year’s second quarter. The decline was driven by the unfavorable impacts of currency, freight, and distribution costs, partially offset by higher average selling prices and the 80 basis point impact of non-recurring charges associated with the move to the company’s new distribution center.•SG&A was $141.5 million compared to $144.3 million in the second quarter of 2018. As a percent of revenues, SG&A improved 460 basis points to 39.4% of revenues compared to 44.0% of revenues in the second quarter of 2018. Second quarter 2019 results included immaterial amounts of non-recurring charges related to various cost reduction activities compared to $8.4 million of non-recurring charges in last year’s second quarter associated with the closure of our company-operated manufacturing and distribution facilities in Mexico and Italy and our SG&A reduction plan.•Income from operations of $47.8 million increased 29.0% compared to $37.1 million in last year’s second quarter. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $39.2 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to $30.4 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in last year’s second quarter. As a result of the repurchase and conversion of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on December 5, 2018, net income attributable to common stockholders in the second quarter of 2019 benefits from the absence of dividends and dividend equivalents adjustments. We had 71.9 million and 71.5 million weighted average diluted common shares outstanding on June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. •To continue improving the efficiency and profitability of our retail business, we closed 8 stores during the three months ended June 30, 2019 and opened 6 stores, to end the quarter with 370 stores, 28 fewer than at June 30, 2018.•We repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $55.0 million.24Table of ContentsResults of Operations Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, % Change 2019 2018 2019 2018 Q2 2019-2018 YTD 2019-2018 (in thousands, except per share, margin, and average selling price data)Revenues$358,899 $328,004 $654,848 $611,152 9.4 % 7.1 %Cost of sales169,520 146,604 327,854 289,879 (15.6)% (13.1)%Gross profit189,379 181,400 326,994 321,273 4.4 % 1.8 %Selling, general and administrative expenses141,548 144,336 246,585 258,287 1.9 % 4.5 %Income from operations47,831 37,064 80,409 62,986 29.0 % 27.7 %Foreign currency gains (losses), net(261) 283 (1,478) 1,354 (192.2)% (209.2)%Interest income131 146 326 425 (10.3)% (23.3)%Interest expense(2,421) (132) (4,238) (245) (1,734.1)% (1,629.8)%Other income(604) 16 (14) 69 (3,875.0)% (120.3)%Income before income taxes44,676 37,377 75,005 64,589 19.5 % 16.1 %Income tax expense 5,478 3,000 11,097 13,758 (82.6)% 19.3 %Net income 39,198 34,377 63,908 50,831 14.0 % 25.7 %Dividends on Series A convertible preferred stock— (3,000) — (6,000) 100.0 % 100.0 %Dividend equivalents on Series A convertible preferred shares related to redemption value accretion and beneficial conversion feature— (951) — (1,882) 100.0 % 100.0 %Net income attributable to common stockholders$39,198 $30,426 $63,908 $42,949 28.8 % 48.8 %Net income per common share:          Basic$0.55 $0.37 $0.89 $0.52 48.6 % 71.2 %Diluted$0.55 $0.35 $0.87 $0.51 57.1 % 70.6 %            Gross margin (1)52.8% 55.3% 49.9% 52.6% (250)bp (270)bpOperating margin (1)13.3% 11.3% 12.3% 10.3% 200bp 200bpFootwear unit sales19,046 17,846 37,478 34,879 6.7 % 7.5 %Average footwear selling price - nominal basis$18.39 $18.05 $17.08 $17.18 1.9 % (0.6)%(1) Changes for gross margin and operating margin are shown in basis points (“bp”).Revenues. Revenues increased $30.9 million, or 9.4%, during the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, reflecting growth in all channels. Higher unit sales volume increased revenues by $14.8 million, or 4.5%. Higher average selling price on a constant currency basis (“ASP”) increased revenues by approximately $26.0 million, or 7.9%. A decrease of $9.9 million, or 3.0%, resulted from unfavorable foreign currency translation. Our wholesale channel grew by 9.4%, with especially strong performance in the Americas during the second quarter. Our e-commerce channel grew by 18.0% due to increased traffic and digital engagement as consumers continued to migrate to online shopping channels, and we continued to invest in digital marketing. Our retail channel increased by 4.0% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018, even as we operated 28 fewer retail stores compared to June 30, 2018. Our retail comparable store sales growth was 11.8% on a global basis. 25Table of ContentsRevenues increased $43.7 million, or 7.1%, in the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. Higher unit sales volume resulted in an increase in revenues of approximately $34.4 million, or 5.6%, and an increase of $32.0 million, or 5.2%, was attributable to a higher ASP, the result of price increases and less promotional discounting. A decrease of $22.7 million, or 3.7%, resulted from unfavorable foreign currency translation. The increase in revenues was led by 7.1% growth in our wholesale channel and 17.5% growth in our e-commerce channel. Our retail channel revenues increased by 1.2% in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, even as we operated 28 fewer retail stores compared to June 30, 2018. Our retail comparable store sales growth of 10.6% reflected increased traffic and higher ASP in our remaining company-operated retail stores. Cost of sales. Cost of sales increased $22.9 million, or 15.6%, during the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Higher unit sales volume resulted in an increase in cost of sales of $9.9 million, or 6.7%. Increases in product costs, freight, and distribution expenses, as well as the unfavorable impacts of non-recurring expenses associated with the relocation of our distribution center and operating our Americas distribution center above capacity contributed to a higher average cost per unit on a constant currency basis (“AUC”). Higher AUC accounted for a $17.6 million, or 12.0%, increase in cost of sales. The impact of foreign currency translation was a decrease of $4.6 million, or 3.1%.During the six months ended June 30, 2019, cost of sales increased $38.0 million, or 13.1%, compared to the same period in 2018. Higher unit sales volume resulted in an increase of $21.6 million, or 7.5%, in cost of sales. Increases in product costs as well as unfavorable impacts of higher freight costs associated with inflation and the use of air shipments and operating our Americas distribution center above capacity contributed to a higher AUC. Higher AUC accounted for a $27.4 million, or 9.4%, increase in cost of sales. The impact of foreign currency translation was a decrease of $11.0 million, or 3.8%, in cost of sales. Gross profit. Gross profit increased $8.0 million, or 4.4%, during the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Gross margin declined 250 basis points to 52.8% compared to the same period in 2018, driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of currency on our purchasing power, increased freight and distribution costs, and strong growth in wholesale revenues, partially offset by savings related to the closure of our company-operated manufacturing facilities in 2018 and higher ASPs. An increase of $12.2 million, or 6.7%, resulted from higher unit sales volume, while an increase of $1.2 million, or 0.6%, resulted from increases in ASP that exceeded increases in AUC. The impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation was a decrease of $5.4 million, or 2.9%.During the six months ended June 30, 2019, gross profit increased $5.7 million, or 1.8%, and gross margin decreased 270 basis points to 49.9% compared to the same period in 2018, driven by the unfavorable impact of currency on our purchasing power and increased freight and distribution center expenses, partially offset by savings related to the closure of our company-operated manufacturing facilities in 2018. Higher unit sales volume drove an increase of approximately $29.8 million, or 9.3%. A decrease of $6.5 million, or 2.0%, resulted from increases in AUC that exceeded increases in ASP. The impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation was a decrease of $17.6 million, or 5.5%.Selling, general and administrative expenses. SG&A decreased $2.8 million, or 1.9%, during the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to an immaterial amount of non-recurring expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $8.4 million in the same period in 2018. The 2018 expenses were due primarily to the closure of our company-operated Mexico and Italy manufacturing and distribution facilities and our SG&A reduction plan. Net decreases in facilities and other expenses of $1.4 million were offset by increased marketing expense of $6.8 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A improved by 460 basis points to 39.4%.SG&A decreased $11.7 million, or 4.5%, for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. As a percent of sales, SG&A improved by 460 basis points to 37.7%. The decrease was primarily due to non-recurring expenses of only $0.9 million compared to $10.9 million for the same period in 2018. The decrease in these expenses is due primarily to the closure of our company-operated manufacturing and distribution facilities in 2018 and our SG&A reduction plan, completed in 2018. Additionally, a decrease of $6.7 million in facilities expense resulted from the reduction in company-operated retail stores and closure of our company-operated manufacturing and distribution facilities and a net decrease in other expenses of $0.6 million were partially offset by higher marketing expense of $5.6 million.Foreign currency gains (losses), net. Foreign currency gains (losses), net, consists of realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses from the remeasurement and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivative instruments. During the three months ended June 30, 2019, we recognized realized and unrealized net foreign currency losses of $0.3 million compared to gains of $0.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018. During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we recognized realized and unrealized net foreign currency losses of $1.5 million, compared to gains of $1.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018. 26Table of ContentsIncome tax expense. During the three months ended June 30, 2019, income tax expense increased $2.5 million compared to the same period in 2018. The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was 12.3% compared to an effective tax rate of 8.0% for the same period in 2018, a 4.3% increase. The increase in the effective rate was driven primarily by tax expense recorded in profitable jurisdictions, partially offset by operating losses in jurisdictions for which the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits, and the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate of 12.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate primarily due to differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, as well as operating losses in certain jurisdictions for which tax benefits cannot be recognized.During the six months ended June 30, 2019, income tax expense decreased $2.7 million compared to the same period in 2018. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was 14.8% compared to an effective tax rate of 21.3% for the same period in 2018, a 6.5% decrease. This decrease in the effective rate was due to operating losses in jurisdictions for which the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits, partially offset by tax expense recorded in profitable jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate of 14.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate due to differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions as well as book losses in certain jurisdictions for which tax benefits cannot be recognized.Our tax rate is volatile and may increase or decrease with changes in, among other things, the amount of income or loss by jurisdiction, our ability to utilize net operating losses and foreign tax credits, changes in tax laws, and the movement of liabilities established pursuant to accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions as statutes of limitations expire, positions are effectively settled, or when additional information becomes available. There are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions and other changes to regulatory environments in countries in which we do business that, if enacted, may have an impact on our effective tax rate.27Table of ContentsRevenues By Channel  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, % Change Constant Currency% Change (1)  2019 2018 2019 2018 Q2 2019-2018 YTD 2019-2018 Q2 2019-2018 YTD 2019-2018  (in thousands)Wholesale:                Americas $69,957 $53,920 $141,186 $126,594 29.7 % 11.5 % 30.8 % 12.9 %Asia Pacific (2) 63,862 65,464 132,812 131,214 (2.4)% 1.2 % 1.1 % 5.5 %EMEA (2) 46,136 44,917 110,627 100,777 2.7 % 9.8 % 8.5 % 18.3 %Other businesses 74 295 126 608 (74.9)% (79.3)% (74.9)% (78.9)%Total wholesale 180,029 164,596 384,751 359,193 9.4 % 7.1 % 12.7 % 11.6 %Retail:                Americas 65,900 56,594 103,976 91,310 16.4 % 13.9 % 16.6 % 14.0 %Asia Pacific 26,865 30,803 40,768 48,417 (12.8)% (15.8)% (7.6)% (11.2)%EMEA 10,688 12,080 16,105 19,256 (11.5)% (16.4)% (7.3)% (10.5)%Total retail 103,453 99,477 160,849 158,983 4.0 % 1.2 % 6.2 % 3.3 %E-commerce:                Americas 34,583 27,248 54,404 43,688 26.9 % 24.5 % 27.2 % 24.9 %Asia Pacific 27,697 26,036 35,891 33,851 6.4 % 6.0 % 12.0 % 11.5 %EMEA 13,137 10,647 18,953 15,437 23.4 % 22.8 % 29.9 % 30.7 %Total e-commerce 75,417 63,931 109,248 92,976 18.0 % 17.5 % 21.5 % 21.0 %Total revenues $358,899 $328,004 $654,848 $611,152 9.4 % 7.1 % 12.5 % 10.9 %(1) Reflects year over year change as if the current period results were in constant currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.

See ‘Impacts of segment composition change’ table below for more information.(3) Unallocated corporate and other includes corporate support and administrative functions, costs associated with share-based compensation, research and development, brand marketing, legal, and depreciation and amortization of corporate and other assets not allocated to operating segments.29Table of ContentsImpacts of segment composition change:  Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Six Months Ended June 30, 2018  Increase (Decrease) (in thousands)Impacts on revenues:    Asia Pacific $(6,097) $(12,080)EMEA 6,097 12,080Impacts on income from operations:    Asia Pacific (2,715) (5,191)EMEA 2,715 5,191Americas Operating Segment Revenues. Revenues for our Americas segment increased $32.7 million, or 23.7%, during the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 29.7% increase in wholesale revenues, resulting from greater customer demand in North America, and a 26.9% increase in e-commerce revenues due to increased traffic and digital engagement. Retail revenues increased by 16.4%, despite operating 4 fewer retail stores compared to the same period last year due to comparable store sales growth of 17.6%. Higher unit sales volume resulted in an increase of $17.3 million, or 12.5%, and an increase in ASP generated $16.1 million, or 11.7%. The impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation was a decrease of $0.7 million, or 0.5%.During the six months ended June 30, 2019, revenues for our Americas segment increased by $38.0 million, or 14.5%, compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in revenues resulted from an 11.5% increase in wholesale revenues, a 13.9% increase in retail revenues, and a 24.5% increase in e-commerce revenues. For all channels combined, a higher ASP resulted in an increase of $24.1 million, or 9.2%, while higher unit sales volume resulted in an increase of $15.9 million, or 6.1%. The impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation was a decrease of $2.0 million, or 0.8%.Income from Operations. Income from operations for the Americas segment was $56.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $17.3 million, or 43.5%, compared to the same period in 2018. Gross profit increased $16.9 million, or 21.4%, and gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 56.2%, compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to an increase of $14.0 million, or 17.7%, from higher unit sales volume and an increase in ASP of $3.2 million, or 4.1%. SG&A for our Americas segment decreased $0.3 million, or 0.9%, during the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to a decrease in information technology expense of $0.6 million, and a net decrease in facilities and other expenses of $0.6 million, partially offset by an increases in compensation of $0.9 million.Income from operations for the Americas segment was $90.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $22.3 million, or 32.7%, compared to the same period in 2018. Gross profit increased $21.9 million, or 15.5%, and gross margin increased 50 basis points to 54.5%, compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in gross profit is due to an increase of $13.3 million, or 9.4%, in our ASP and an increase of $9.5 million, or 6.8%, from higher unit sales volume. The impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation was a decrease of $0.9 million, or 0.7%.During the six months ended June 30, 2019, SG&A for our Americas segment decreased $0.4 million, or 0.6%, compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease in SG&A was due to decreases of $1.3 million in compensation expense and $1.0 million in facilities expense as a result of the reduction in the number of company-operated retail stores, partially offset by increases in marketing expense of $0.7 million, professional service expenses of $0.7 million, and a net increase of $0.5 million in other expenses, none of which were individually significant.Asia Pacific Operating SegmentRevenues. Revenues for our Asia Pacific segment decreased $3.9 million, or 3.2%, during the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Retail revenues decreased by 12.8% as we operated 15 fewer stores in the region compared to the same period last year, with comparable store sales growth of 0.7%, and wholesale revenues decreased by 2.4%.

Income from operations for the Asia Pacific segment was $28.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, a decrease of $5.6 million, or 16.6%, compared to the same period in 2018. Gross profit decreased $7.9 million, or 10.9%, and gross margin decreased 470 basis points to 54.7% compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease in gross profit was due to the $3.0 million, or 4.1%, impact of increases in AUC that exceeded ASP gains and lower unit sales volume of $1.8 million, or 2.5%. The impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation was a decrease of $3.1 million, or 4.3%.SG&A for our Asia Pacific segment decreased $2.3 million, or 5.9%, during the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to decreases in facilities expense, compensation expense, and loss on disposals totaling $4.4 million as a result of the reduction in the number of company-operated retail stores in 2018, partially offset by an increase in marketing expense of $2.4 million. Income from operations for the Asia Pacific segment was $54.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, a decrease of $3.0 million, or 5.2%, compared to the same period in 2018.

The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to decreases in facilities expense, compensation expense, loss on disposals, and depreciation expense totaling $9.0 million as a result of the reduction in the number of company-operated retail stores in 2018 combined with decreases in professional service expense of $0.7 million, and impairment expenses $0.6 million, partially offset by an increase of $3.0 million in marketing expense.EMEA Operating Segment Revenues. Revenues for our EMEA segment increased $2.3 million, or 3.4%, during the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. E-commerce revenue grew 23.4%, and wholesale revenue grew 2.7%, more than offsetting a decline of 11.5% in retail results as we operated 9 fewer stores in the region compared to the same period last year. Our retail comparable store sales growth was 8.2%. A higher ASP resulted in an increase of $4.0 million, or 5.8%, and higher unit sales volume resulted in an increase of $2.2 million, or 3.2%. The impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation was a decrease of $3.9 million, or 5.6%.During the six months ended June 30, 2019, revenues for our EMEA segment increased $10.2 million, or 7.5%, compared to the same period in 2018. E-commerce revenue grew 22.8% and wholesale revenue grew 9.8%, more than offsetting a 16.4% decline in retail results as we operated 9 fewer stores in the region compared to the same period last year. Higher unit sales volume resulted in an increase of $19.1 million, or 14.1%, and an increase of $2.0 million, or 1.5%, resulted from a higher ASP. The impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation was a decrease of $10.9 million, or 8.1%. Income from Operations. Income from operations for the EMEA segment was $22.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $1.1 million, or 5.2%, compared to the same period in 2018. Gross profit for the EMEA segment decreased $0.7 million, or 1.9%, and gross margin decreased 280 basis points to 52.5% compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the net impact of an increase of $1.2 million, or 3.3%, from higher unit sales volume and a $2.0 million, or 5.4%, decrease from foreign currency translation.SG&A for our EMEA segment decreased $1.8 million, or 11.3%, during the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to reductions of $0.8 million in compensation expense, $0.5 million in facilities expense, and net decreases in $0.5 million in professional service and other expenses.31Table of ContentsIncome from operations for the EMEA segment was $47.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $5.8 million, or 13.9%, compared to the same period in 2018. During the six months ended June 30, 2019, gross profit increased $1.5 million, or 2.0%, and gross margin decreased by 270 basis points to 50.6% compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in gross profit is due to the net impact of an increase of $11.4 million, or 15.8%, due to the favorable impact of unit sales volume, a decrease of $4.4 million, or 6.1%, due to a lower ASP, and a decrease of $5.5 million, or 7.7%, from foreign currency translation. During the six months ended June 30, 2019, SG&A for our EMEA segment decreased $4.3 million, or 14.2%, compared to the same period in 2018.The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to decreases of $2.3 million in compensation expense and $1.8 million in facilities expense as a result of the reduction in company-operated retail stores.Other Businesses and Unallocated CorporateDuring the three months ended June 30, 2019, total net costs within ‘Other Businesses’ and ‘Unallocated Corporate and Other’ increased $2.0 million compared to the same period in 2018. The increase was due primarily to higher marketing expense of $4.4 million and higher professional service expense of $3.0 million, partially offset by decrease in compensation expense of $4.9 million.During the six months ended June 30, 2019, total net costs within ‘Other Businesses and Unallocated Corporate’ increased by $7.7 million compared to the same period in 2018. The increase was due primarily to higher net cost of sales totaling $4.5 million and increases in marketing expense of $1.9 million and professional service expense of $1.1 million.Store Locations and Comparable Store SalesThe tables below illustrate the overall change in the number of our company-operated retail locations by type of store and reportable operating segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019:   March 31, 2019 Opened Closed June 30, 2019Company-operated retail locations:        Type:        Outlet stores 192 4 4 192Retail stores 114 1 3 112Kiosk/store in store 66 1 1 66Total 372 6 8 370Operating segment:        Americas 166 — 1 165Asia Pacific 147 6 7 146EMEA 59 — — 59Total 372 6 8 370  December 31, 2018 Opened Closed/Transferred June 30, 2019Type:        Outlet stores 195 4 7 192Retail stores 120 1 9 112Kiosk/store-in-store 68 1 3 66Total 383 6 19 370Operating segment:        Americas 168 — 3 165Asia Pacific 153 6 13 146EMEA 62 — 3 59Total 383 6 19 37032Table of ContentsComparable retail store sales and direct-to-consumer store sales by operating segment were: Constant Currency (1) Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018Comparable retail store sales: (2)         Americas17.6% 7.5% 15.6% 8.8%  Asia Pacific0.7% 2.9% 0.3% 3.6%  EMEA8.2% 16.4% 8.6% 9.2%  Global11.8% 7.1% 10.6% 7.3% Constant Currency (1) Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018Direct-to-consumer comparable store sales (includes retail and e-commerce): (2)         Americas20.8% 10.4% 18.7% 11.4%  Asia Pacific3.5% 11.6% 3.0% 11.2%  EMEA14.5% 18.0% 16.0% 13.2%  Global14.2% 11.8% 13.5% 11.6%(1) Reflects period over period change on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using exchange rates used in the prior comparative period.(2) Comparable store status is determined on a monthly basis. Comparable store sales includes the revenues of stores that have been in operation for more than twelve months. Stores in which selling square footage has changed more than 15% as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded until the thirteenth month in which they have comparable prior year sales. Temporarily closed stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation during the month of closure. Location closures in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month post re-opening. E-commerce revenues are based on same site sales period over period.33Table of ContentsFinancial Condition, Capital Resources, and LiquidityLiquidityOur liquidity position as of June 30, 2019 was:  June 30, 2019  (in thousands)Cash and cash equivalents $107,822Available borrowings 80,400As of June 30, 2019, we had $107.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and up to $80.4 million of remaining availability under our revolving credit facilities. We believe that cash flows from operations, our cash and cash equivalents on hand, and available borrowings under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility and other financing instruments will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. Additional future financing may be necessary to fund our operations and there can be no assurance that, if needed, we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term, the success of our operations, the global economic outlook, and the pace of sustainable growth in our markets, among other factors, could impact our business and liquidity. Due to the seasonal nature of our footwear, which is more heavily focused on styles suitable for warm weather, cash flows from operating activities during our first quarter are typically lower as customer receivables and inventories rise in preparation for the Spring/Summer season. Cash flows from operating activities generated during our second and third quarters are generally higher, when the northern hemisphere is experiencing warmer weather. Accordingly, results of operations and cash flows for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of expected results for any other quarter or for any other year.Repatriation of CashAs a global business, we have cash balances in various countries and amounts are denominated in various currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations and cash positions. Future fluctuations in foreign currencies may have a material impact on our cash flows and capital resources. Cash balances held in foreign countries may have additional restrictions and covenants associated with them which could adversely impact our liquidity and our ability to timely access and transfer cash balances between entities.Most of the cash held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. In some countries, repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws and could have adverse tax consequences if we were to move the cash to another country. As of June 30, 2019, we held $86.4 million of our total $107.8 million in cash in international locations. This cash is primarily used for the ongoing operations of the business in the locations in which the cash is held. None of the $86.4 million held in international locations could potentially be limited by local regulations. If the remaining $86.4 million were to be immediately repatriated to the U.S., no additional U.S. federal income tax expense would be incurred. Senior Revolving Credit FacilityIn December 2011, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility (the “Facility”), pursuant to an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), with the lenders named therein and PNC Bank, National Association, as a lender and administrative agent for the lenders. The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict certain actions by the Company, including limitations on: (i) stock repurchases to an aggregate of $250.0 million per fiscal year, subject to certain restrictions; and (ii) capital expenditures and commitments to $70.0 million per year. The Credit Agreement also permits intercompany loans of up to $375.0 million and requires the Company to meet certain financial covenant ratios that become effective when average outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, including letters of credit, exceed the lesser of $40.0 million or 40% of the total commitments during certain periods or if the outstanding borrowings exceed the borrowing base. If the financial covenant ratios are in effect, the Company must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of (i) 2.75 to 1.00 at June 30, 2019, (ii) 2.50 to 1.00 at September 30, 2019 and the last day of each quarter thereafter. As of June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.As of June 30, 2019, the total commitments available from the lenders under the Facility were $300.0 million. At June 30, 2019, the Company had $215.0 million in outstanding borrowings, which are due in February 2021, and $4.6 million in outstanding 34Table of Contentsletters of credit under the Facility, which reduces amounts available for borrowing under the Facility. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had $80.4 million and $129.4 million, respectively, of available borrowing capacity under the Facility.The Company also has a revolving credit facility in Asia, under which the Company had no borrowings during the three months ended June 30, 2019 and year ended December 31, 2018 or borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.Amended Senior Revolving Credit FacilityOn July 26, 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (the “Borrowers”) entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Restated Credit Agreement”) with the lenders named therein and PNC Bank, National Association, as a lender and administrative agent. The Restated Credit Agreement replaces the Credit Agreement described above.The Restated Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $450.0 million, which can be increased by an additional $150.0 million subject to certain conditions, and the Restated Credit Agreement will mature on July 26, 2024. Borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate based on a domestic base rate or a LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.875% based on the Company’s leverage ratio.Among other things, the Restated Credit Agreement amended the prior Credit Agreement to (i) require the Company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 4.00 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 from September 30, 2019 to September 30, 2020, decreasing to 3.25 to 1.00 from December 31, 2020 and thereafter (subject to an increase to 4.00 to 1.00 in the event of certain permitted acquisitions or stock repurchases); (ii) allow stock repurchases so long as after giving effect to such stock repurchases, the maximum leverage ratio does not exceed the applicable maximum leverage ratio, less 0.25; (iii) allow permitted acquisitions so long as there is borrowing availability under the Restated Credit Agreement of at least $40.0 million; and (iv) amend certain other covenants and provisions to be more favorable to the Borrowers. Except as described above, the other material terms of the Restated Credit Agreement are substantially the same as the prior Credit Agreement.Cash Flows Six Months Ended June 30,   2019 2018 $ Change % Change (in thousands)  Cash provided by operating activities$20,168 $40,861 $(20,693) (50.6)%Cash used in investing activities(18,462) (3,212) (15,250) (474.8)%Cash used in financing activities(18,095) (32,823) 14,728 44.9 %Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash410 (6,183) 6,593 106.6 %Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$(15,979) $(1,357) $(14,622) 1,077.5 %Operating Activities. Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities, consisting of net income adjusted for noncash items and changes in working capital. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $20.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities resulted from the combined impacts of an increase in net income as adjusted for non-cash items, which resulted in a favorable change of $38.3 million, and an unfavorable change in our operating assets and liabilities of $59.0 million, which was primarily due to the current year to date change in operating lease liabilities as a result of the adoption of the new lease accounting standard as of January 1, 2019, higher variable compensation, changes in income tax liabilities, and changes from the prior year adoption of the new revenue standard.Investing Activities. The $15.3 million increase in cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily reflects expenditures on the planned relocation of the Company’s Americas distribution center from California to Ohio.Financing Activities. The $14.7 million decrease in cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018 resulted primarily from borrowings of $95.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $0.7 million of repayments on borrowings for the same period in 2018. Additionally, we made $3.0 million less in payments in 2019 related to Series A Convertible Preferred Stock due to the conversion of these shares in 2018. 35Table of ContentsThese items were more than offset by the repurchase of 4.6 million shares of our common stock for approximately $108.5 million compared to 1.8 million shares for approximately $25.9 million in the first six months of 2018.Contractual ObligationsThere have been no significant changes to the contractual obligations reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, other than borrowings on the Facility, as described in Note 7 — Revolving Credit Facilities and Bank Borrowings in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2019, other than lease obligations for leases that have not yet commenced, which are described in Note 4 — Leases, and certain purchase commitments, which are described in Note 13 — Commitments and Contingencies, both of which are in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. As of January 1, 2019, we adopted authoritative guidance related to accounting for lease agreements using the modified retrospective method of adoption with the cumulative effect recognized through retained earnings upon adoption. The comparative information presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements was not restated and is reported under the accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed it to carry forward existing lease classification and to exclude leases with original terms of one year or less. Further, the Company elected to combine lease and non-lease components, and did not elect to use hindsight in applying the new standard. Due to the Company’s centralized treasury function, the Company utilizes a portfolio approach to discount its lease obligations. The Company assesses the expected lease term at lease inception and discounts the lease using a fully-secured annual incremental borrowing rate provided by the Company’s lender, adjusted for time value corresponding with the expected lease term. The adoption of this guidance did not have, and is not expected to have, a significant impact on our reported revenues, gross margins, income from operations, or cash flows. The adoption of this guidance resulted in recognition of significant new right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.For a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and Note 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no other significant changes in our critical accounting policies or their application since December 31, 2018.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, and issued accounting pronouncements that we believe may have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when adopted.36Table of ContentsITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate Risk We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our Facility and certain financial instruments. Borrowings under our Facility bear interest at a variable rate and are therefore subject to risk based upon prevailing market interest rates. Interest rates fluctuate as a result of many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control. As of June 30, 2019, we had $215.0 million in outstanding borrowings and $4.6 million in outstanding letters of credit under our Facility. As of December 31, 2018, we had $120.0 million in outstanding borrowings and $0.6 million in outstanding letters of credit under our Facility. A hypothetical increase of 1% in the interest rate on these borrowings would have increased interest expense by $0.6 million and $1.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. Foreign Currency Exchange RiskAs a global company, we have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. We are exposed to the risk of gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities within our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary’s functional currency. Likewise, our U.S. companies are also exposed to the risk of gains and losses and the resulting changes in exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar.We have experienced and will continue to experience changes in international currency rates, impacting both results of operations and the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to buy or sell various foreign currencies to selectively protect against volatility in the value of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings in the period that the changes occur. As of June 30, 2019, the U.S. Dollar notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts was approximately $167.3 million. The net fair value of these contracts at June 30, 2019 was a liability of $0.5 million. We perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts. To perform the sensitivity analysis, we assess the risk of changes in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by the foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the U.S. Dollar. As of June 30, 2019, a 10% appreciation in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a net increase in the fair value of our derivative portfolio of approximately $0.2 million. Effects of Changes in Exchange Rates on Translated Results of International Subsidiaries Changes in exchange rates have a direct effect on our reported U.S. Dollar consolidated financial statements because we translate the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries to U.S. Dollars using current period exchange rates. Specifically, we translate the statements of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into the U.S. Dollar reporting currency using exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. As a result, comparisons of reported results between reporting periods may be impacted significantly due to differences in the exchange rates used to translate the operating results of our international subsidiaries. For example, in our EMEA operating segment, when the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to the Euro, our reported U.S. Dollar results are lower than if there had been no change in the exchange rate, because more Euros are required to generate the same U.S. Dollar translated amount. Conversely, when the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to the Euro, the reported U.S. Dollar results of our EMEA operating segment are higher compared to a period with a stronger U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro. Similarly, the reported U.S. Dollar results of our Asia Pacific operating segment, where the functional currencies are primarily the Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, Korean Won and the Singapore Dollar, are comparatively lower or higher when the U.S. Dollar strengthens or weakens, respectively, relative to these currencies.An increase of 1% of the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies would have decreased our income before taxes during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 by approximately $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, excluding the impact on our purchasing power. The volatility of the exchange rates is dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. See Part I - Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates on our U.S. Dollar condensed consolidated statements of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.37Table of ContentsITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such item is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2019, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures that, by their nature, can only provide reasonable assurance regarding management’s control objectives.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the three months ended June 30, 2019, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.38Table of ContentsPART II — Other Information ITEM 1.

On May 5, 2019, the Board approved an increase to the repurchase authorization of up to an additional $500.0 million of the Company’s common stock. As of June 30, 2019, approximately $547.3 million remained available for repurchase under our share repurchase authorization. The number, price, structure and timing of the repurchases, if any, will be at our sole discretion and future repurchases will be evaluated by us depending on market conditions, liquidity needs, restrictions under our debt arrangements, and other factors. Share repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and does not oblige us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. The Board may suspend, modify, or terminate the repurchase program at any time without prior notice.39Table of ContentsITEM 5. Other InformationOn July 26, 2019, the Company and its subsidiaries, Crocs Retail, LLC, Jibbitz, LLC, Colorado Footwear C.V. and Crocs Europe B.V. (collectively with the Company, the “Borrowers”) entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Restated Credit Agreement”) with the lenders named therein and PNC Bank, National Association, as a lender and administrative agent. The Credit Agreement replaces the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated December 16, 2011, entered into by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (as amended, the “Prior Facility”).The Restated Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $450.0 million, which can be increased by an additional $150.0 million subject to certain conditions, and the Restated Credit Agreement will mature on July 26, 2024. Borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate based on a domestic base rate or a LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.875% based on the Company’s leverage ratio.The Restated Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, financial covenants, representations and warranties, events of default and other provisions. Among other things, the Restated Credit Agreement amended the Prior Facility to (i) require the Company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 4.00 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 from September 30, 2019 to September 30, 2020, decreasing to 3.25 to 1.00 from December 31, 2020 and thereafter (subject to an increase to 4.00 to 1.00 in the event of certain permitted acquisitions or stock repurchases); (ii) allow stock repurchases so long as after giving effect to such stock repurchases, the maximum leverage ratio does not exceed the applicable maximum leverage ratio, less 0.25; (iii) allow permitted acquisitions so long as there is borrowing availability under the Restated Credit Agreement of at least $40.0 million; and (iv) amend certain other covenants and provisions to be more favorable to the Borrowers. Except as described above, the other material terms of the Restated Credit Agreement are substantially the same as the Prior Facility.Borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement are secured by all of the assets of the Borrowers, and guaranteed by certain other subsidiaries of the Borrowers. The above summary does not purport to be a complete summary of the Restated Credit Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Restated Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.40Table of ContentsITEM 6.

Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each Lender severally agrees to make Revolving Credit Loans to the Borrowers at any time or from time to time on or after the date hereof to the Expiration Date; provided that after giving effect to each such Loan (i) the aggregate amount of Revolving Credit Loans from such Lender shall not exceed such Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment minus such Lender’s Ratable Share of the Letter of Credit Obligations and Swing Loans and (ii) the Revolving Facility Usage shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Commitments. Within such limits of time and amount and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Borrowers may borrow, repay and reborrow pursuant to this Section 2.1.2.1.2    Swing Loan Commitment.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and relying upon the representations and warranties herein specified and the agreements of the other Lenders specified in Section 2.5 [Making Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Loans; Presumptions by the Administrative Agent; Repayment of Revolving Credit Loans; Borrowings to Repay Swing Loans] with respect to Swing Loans, PNC may, at its option, cancelable at any time for any reason whatsoever, make swing loans (the “Swing Loans”) to the Borrowers at any time or from time to time after the Closing Date to, but not including, the Expiration Date, in an aggregate principal amount up to but not in excess of the Swing Loan Commitment, provided that after giving effect to such Swing Loan, (i) the aggregate amount of any Lender’s Revolving Credit Loans plus such Lender’s Ratable Share of the outstanding Swing Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations shall not exceed such Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment and (ii) the Revolving Facility Usage shall not exceed the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders.

Accruing from the date hereof until the Expiration Date, the Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender according to its Ratable Share, a nonrefundable commitment fee (the “Commitment Fee”) equal to the applicable Commitment Fee as set forth in the definition of Applicable Margin (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed) multiplied by the average daily difference between the amount of (i) the Revolving Credit Commitments (for purposes of this computation, PNC’s Swing Loans shall be deemed to be borrowed amounts under its Revolving Credit Commitment) and (ii) the Revolving Facility Usage; provided, however, that any Commitment Fee accrued with respect to the Revolving Credit Commitment of a Defaulting Lender during the period prior to the time such Lender became a Defaulting Lender and unpaid at such time shall not be payable by the Borrowers so long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender except to the extent that such Commitment Fee shall otherwise have been due and payable by the Borrowers prior to such time; and provided further that no Commitment Fee shall accrue with respect to the Revolving Commitment of a Defaulting Lender so long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender. Subject to the proviso in the directly preceding sentence, all Commitment Fees shall be payable in arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter with respect to the previous calendar quarter.2.4    Revolving Credit Loan Requests; Swing Loan Requests.  2.4.1    Revolving Credit Loan Requests.

The Administrative Agent shall, promptly after receipt by it of a Loan Request pursuant to Section 2.4 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests; Swing Loan Requests], notify the Lenders of its receipt of such Loan Request specifying the information provided by the Borrowers and the apportionment among the Lenders of the requested Revolving Credit Loans as determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.2 [Nature of Lenders’ Obligations with Respect to Revolving Credit Loans]. Each Lender shall remit its apportioned share (as provided to it by the Administrative Agent) of the principal amount of each Revolving Credit Loan to the Administrative Agent such that the Administrative Agent is able to, and the Administrative Agent shall, to the extent the Lenders have made funds available to it for such purpose and subject to Section 7.2 [Each Loan or Letter of Credit], fund such Revolving Credit Loans to the Borrowers in U.S. Dollars and immediately available funds at the Principal Office prior to 3:00 p.m., on the applicable Borrowing Date; provided that (x) if any Lender fails to remit such funds to the Administrative Agent in a timely manner, the Administrative Agent may elect in its sole discretion to fund with its own funds the Revolving Credit Loans of such Lender on such Borrowing Date, and such Lender shall be subject to the repayment obligation in Section 2.5.2 [Presumptions by the Administrative Agent], and (y) for the avoidance of doubt, no proceeds of any Revolving Credit Loan shall be disbursed to, or deposited in, any deposit account, securities account or other account of any Loan Party located or titled in Bermuda. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and each Lender at its option may make any Credit Extension or otherwise perform its obligations hereunder through any Lending Office; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay any Credit Extension in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. - 41 -2.5.2    Presumptions by the Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Loan that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Loan, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.5.1 [Making Revolving Credit Loans] and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Loan available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrowers to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Effective Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrowers, the interest rate applicable to Loans under the Base Rate Option; provided, however, that Agent shall first make demand for repayment upon such Lender prior to making demand on Borrowers. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Loan to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan. Any payment by the Borrowers shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrowers may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.2.5.3    Making Swing Loans. So long as PNC elects to make Swing Loans, PNC shall, after receipt by it of a Swing Loan Request pursuant to Section 2.4.2, [Swing Loan Requests] fund such Swing Loan to the Borrowers in U.S. Dollars and immediately available funds at the Principal Office prior to 4:00 p.m. on the Borrowing Date.2.5.4    Repayment of Revolving Credit Loans.  The Borrowers shall repay the outstanding principal amount of all Revolving Credit Loans together with all outstanding interest thereon on the Expiration Date. 2.5.5    Borrowings to Repay Swing Loans. (i)    PNC may, at its option, exercisable at any time for any reason whatsoever, demand repayment of the Swing Loans, and each Lender shall make a Revolving Credit Loan in an amount equal to such Lender’s Ratable Share of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Swing Loans, plus, if PNC so requests, accrued interest thereon, provided that no Lender shall be obligated in any event to make Revolving Credit Loans in excess of its Revolving Credit Commitment minus its Ratable Share of Letter of Credit Obligations. Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall bear interest at the Base Rate Option and shall be deemed to have been properly requested in accordance with Section 2.4.1 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests] without regard to any of the requirements of that provision. PNC shall provide notice to the Lenders (which may be telephonic or written notice by letter, facsimile or telex) that such Revolving Credit Loans are to be made under this Section 2.5.5 and of the apportionment among the Lenders, and the Lenders shall be unconditionally obligated to fund such Revolving Credit Loans - 42 -(whether or not the conditions specified in Section 2.4.1 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests] are then satisfied) by the time PNC so requests, which shall not be later than 3:00 p.m. on the Business Day after the date the Lenders receive such notice from PNC. (ii)    If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of PNC (as the Swing Loan Lender) any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.5.5(i) by the time specified in Section 2.5.5(i), the Swing Loan Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Loan Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Effective Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swing Loan Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Revolving Credit Loan with respect to such prepayment. A certificate of the Swing Loan Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (ii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.2.5.6    Swing Loans Under Cash Management Agreements.  In addition to making Swing Loans pursuant to the foregoing provisions of Section 2.5.3 [Making Swing Loans], without the requirement for a specific request from the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.4.2 [Swing Loan Requests], PNC as the Swing Loan Lender may make Swing Loans to the Borrowers in accordance with the provisions of the agreements between the Borrowers and such Swing Loan Lender relating to the Borrower’s deposit, sweep and other accounts at such Swing Loan Lender and related arrangements and agreements regarding the management and investment of the Borrower’s cash assets as in effect from time to time (the “Cash Management Agreements”) to the extent of the daily aggregate net negative balance in the Borrower’s accounts which are subject to the provisions of the Cash Management Agreements. Swing Loans made pursuant to this Section 2.5.6 in accordance with the provisions of the Cash Management Agreements shall (i) be subject to the limitations as to aggregate amount set forth in Section 2.1.2 [Swing Loan Commitment], (ii) not be subject to the limitations as to individual amount set forth in Section 2.4.2 [Swing Loan Requests], (iii) be payable by the Borrowers, both as to principal and interest, at the rates and times set forth in the Cash Management Agreements (but in no event later than the Expiration Date), (iv) not be made at any time after such Swing Loan Lender has received written notice of the occurrence of an Event of Default and so long as such shall continue to exist, or, unless consented to by the Required Lenders, a Potential Default and so long as such shall continue to exist, (v) if not repaid by the Borrowers in accordance with the provisions of the Cash Management Agreements, be subject to each Lender’s obligation pursuant to Section 2.5.5 [Borrowings to Repay Swing Loans], and (vi) except as provided in the foregoing subsections (i) through (v), be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Article 2.- 43 -2.6    Notes.  The Obligation of the Borrowers to repay the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Loans made to it by each Lender, together with interest thereon, shall be evidenced by a revolving credit Note and a swing Note dated the Closing Date payable to the order of such Lender in a face amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment or Swing Loan Commitment as applicable, of such Lender.2.7    Use of Proceeds.

The Borrowers shall authorize and direct the Issuing Lender to name the Borrowers as the “Applicant” or “Account Party” of each Letter of Credit. Promptly after receipt of any letter of credit application, the Issuing Lender shall confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit application and if not, such Issuing Lender will provide Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the Issuing Lender has received notice from any Lender, Administrative Agent or the Borrowers, at least one day prior to the requested date of issuance, amendment or extension of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions in Section 7 [Conditions of Lending and Issuance of Letters of Credit] is not satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in reliance on the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.8, the Issuing Lender or any of the Issuing Lender’s Affiliates will issue a Letter of Credit or agree to such amendment or extension, provided that each Letter of Credit shall (A) have a maximum maturity of twelve (12) months from the date of issuance, and (B) in no event expire later than the Expiration Date and provided further that in no event shall (i) the Letter of Credit Obligations exceed, at any one time, $20,000,000 (the “Letter of Credit Sublimit”) or (ii) the Revolving Facility Usage - 44 -exceed, at any one time, the Revolving Credit Commitments.

Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable Issuing Lender will also deliver to Borrowers and Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. As of the Closing Date, each of the Existing Letters of Credit shall constitute, for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, a Letter of Credit issued and outstanding hereunder.

(ii)    Notwithstanding Section 2.8.1(i), the Issuing Lender shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Official Body or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Lender from issuing the Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the Issuing Lender or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Official Body with jurisdiction over the Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or the Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Lender with respect to the Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the Issuing Lender any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the Issuing Lender in good faith deems material to it, (B) the issuance of the Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the Issuing Lender applicable to letters of credit generally or (C) any Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the Issuing Lender has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to the Issuing Lender (in its sole discretion) with the Borrowers or such Lender to eliminate the Issuer Lender’s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.9(a)(iv) [Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other Issuer Lender Obligations as to which the Issuing Lender has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion.2.8.2    Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrowers shall pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders a fee (the “Letter of Credit Fee”) equal to the Applicable Letter of Credit Fee Rate times the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit, - 45 -and (ii) to the Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee equal to 0.25% per annum on the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit.

The Borrowers shall also pay to the Issuing Lender for the Issuing Lender’s sole account the Issuing Lender’s then in effect customary fees and administrative expenses payable with respect to the Letters of Credit as the Issuing Lender may generally charge or incur from time to time in connection with the issuance, maintenance, amendment (if any), assignment or transfer (if any), negotiation, and administration of Letters of Credit.2.8.3    Disbursements, Reimbursement. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Lender a participation in such Letter of Credit and each drawing thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender’s Ratable Share of the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively.2.8.3.1    In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent thereof. Provided that it shall have received such notice, the Borrowers shall reimburse (such obligation to reimburse the Issuing Lender shall sometimes be referred to as a “Reimbursement Obligation”) the Issuing Lender prior to 12:00 noon on each date that an amount is paid by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit (each such date, a “Drawing Date”) by paying to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender an amount equal to the amount so paid by the Issuing Lender. In the event the Borrowers fail to reimburse the Issuing Lender (through the Administrative Agent) for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by 12:00 noon on the Drawing Date, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender thereof, and the Borrowers shall be deemed to have requested that Revolving Credit Loans be made by the Lenders under the Base Rate Option to be disbursed on the Drawing Date under such Letter of Credit, subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Loan or Letter of Credit] other than any notice requirements. Any notice given by the Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.8.3.1 may be oral if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.2.8.3.2    Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.8.3.1 make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender an amount in immediately available funds equal to its Ratable Share of the amount of the drawing, whereupon the participating Lenders shall (subject to Section 2.8.3 [Disbursement; Reimbursement]) each be deemed to have made a Revolving Credit Loan under the Base Rate Option to the Borrowers in that amount. If any Lender so notified fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender the amount of such Lender’s Ratable Share of such amount by no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Drawing Date, then interest shall accrue on such Lender’s obligation to make such payment, from the Drawing Date to the date on which such Lender makes such payment (i) at a rate per annum equal to the Effective Federal Funds Rate during the first three (3) days - 46 -following the Drawing Date and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to Loans under the Revolving Credit Base Rate Option on and after the fourth day following the Drawing Date. The Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender will promptly give notice (as described in Section 2.8.3.1 above) of the occurrence of the Drawing Date, but failure of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender to give any such notice on the Drawing Date or in sufficient time to enable any Lender to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Lender from its obligation under this Section 2.8.3.2.2.8.3.3    With respect to any unreimbursed drawing that is not converted into Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option to the Borrowers in whole or in part as contemplated by Section 2.8.3.1, because of the Borrower’s failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Loan or Letter of Credit] other than any notice requirements, or for any other reason, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have incurred from the Issuing Lender a borrowing (each a “Letter of Credit Borrowing”) in the amount of such drawing. Such Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option. Each Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.8.3 [Disbursements, Reimbursement] shall be deemed to be a payment in respect of its participation in such Letter of Credit Borrowing (each a “Participation Advance”) from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.8.3.2.8.4    Repayment of Participation Advances.2.8.4.1    Upon (and only upon) receipt by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender of immediately available funds from the Borrowers (i) in reimbursement of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under the Letter of Credit with respect to which any Lender has made a Participation Advance to the Administrative Agent, or (ii) in payment of interest on such a payment made by the Issuing Lender under such a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Issuing Lender will pay to each Lender, in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent, the amount of such Lender’s Ratable Share of such funds, except the Administrative Agent shall retain for the account of the Issuing Lender the amount of the Ratable Share of such funds of any Lender that did not make a Participation Advance in respect of such payment by the Issuing Lender.2.8.4.2    If the Administrative Agent is required at any time to return to any Loan Party, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or any official in any Insolvency Proceeding, any portion of any payment made by any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section in reimbursement of a payment made under the Letter of Credit or interest or fee thereon, each Lender shall, on demand of the Administrative Agent, forthwith return to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender the amount of its Ratable Share of any amounts so returned by the Administrative Agent plus interest thereon from the date such demand is made to the date such amounts are returned by such Lender to the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the Effective Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time.- 47 -2.8.5    Documentation.  Each Loan Party agrees to be bound by the terms of the Issuing Lender’s application and agreement for letters of credit and the Issuing Lender’s written regulations and customary practices relating to letters of credit, though such interpretation may be different from such Loan Party’s own. In the event of a conflict between such application or agreement and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern.

As between any Loan Party and the Issuing Lender, or the Issuing Lender’s Affiliates, such Loan Party assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for any of the following, including any losses or damages to any Loan Party or other Person or property relating therefrom: (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for an issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged (even if the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates shall have been notified thereof); (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) the failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit, or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred, to comply fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit or any other claim of any Loan Party against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, or any such transferee, or any dispute between or among any Loan Party and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any such transferee; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates, as applicable, including any act or omission of any Official Body, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of the Issuing Lender’s or its Affiliates rights or powers hereunder.

In no event shall the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates be liable to any Loan Party for any indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or special damages or expenses (including without limitation attorneys’ fees), or for any damages resulting from any change in the value of any property relating to a Letter of Credit.

Each Issuing Lender shall, on the first Business Day of each month, provide to Administrative Agent and Borrowers a schedule of the Letters of Credit issued by it, in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent, showing the date of issuance of each Letter of Credit, the account party, the original face amount (if any), and the expiration date of any Letter of Credit outstanding at any time during the preceding month, and any other information relating to such Letter of Credit that the Administrative Agent may request.2.9    Defaulting Lenders.

Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as specified in the definition of Required Lenders;(B)    Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article 9 [Default] or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.2.3 [Setoff] shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: - 51 -first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Lender or Swing Loan Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lender’s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 5.13 [Cash Collateral]; fourth, as the Borrowers may request (so long as no Potential Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lender’s future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 5.13 [Cash Collateral]; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Lender or Swing Loan Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Lender or Swing Loan Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Potential Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrowers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrowers against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or Letter of Credit Borrowing in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions specified in Section 7.2 [Each Loan or Letter of Credit] were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and Letter of Credit Borrowings owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or Letter of Credit Borrowing owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letter of Credit Obligations and Swing Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments under the applicable Facility without giving effect to Section 2.9(i)(D) [Reallocation of Participation to Reduce Fronting Exposure]. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.9(i)(D) [Defaulting Lender Waterfall] shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.(C)    Certain Fees. (I)    No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender). (II)    Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Ratable Share of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 5.12 [Cash Collateral]. (III) With respect to any Commitment Fee, or Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.9 [Defaulting Lenders], the Borrowers shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such - 52 -Defaulting Lender’s participation in Letter of Credit Obligations or Swing Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (D) below, (y) pay to each Issuing Lender and Swing Loan Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Lender’s or Swing Loan Lender’s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.(D)     Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s participation in Letter of Credit Obligations and Swing Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Ratable Shares (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Facility Usage of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.(E)    Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swing Loans. If the reallocation described in clause (D) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swing Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Loan Lender’s Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lender’s Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures specified in Section 5.13 [Cash Collateral].(ii)    Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and Swing Loan Lender and Issuing Lender agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions specified therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments under the applicable Facility (without giving effect to Section 2.9(a)(iv) [Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure], whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.(iii)    New Swing Loans/Letters of Credit. So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swing Loan Lender shall not be required to fund any Swing Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swing Loan and (ii) no Issuing - 53 -Lender shall be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.2.10    Increase in Revolving Credit Commitments.2.10.1    Increasing Lenders and New Lenders. The Borrowers may, at any time and from time to time, request that (1) the current Lenders increase their Revolving Credit Commitments (any current Lender which elects to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment shall be referred to as an “Increasing Lender”) or (2) one or more new lenders (each a “New Lender”) join this Agreement and provide a Revolving Credit Commitment hereunder, subject to the following terms and conditions: (i)    No Obligation to Increase.

The Loan Parties shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on or before the effective date of such increase the following documents in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent: (1) certifications of their corporate secretaries with attached resolutions certifying that the increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment has been approved by such Loan Parties, and (2) an opinion of counsel addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders addressing the authorization and execution of the Loan Documents by, and enforceability of the Loan Documents against, the Loan Parties. (v)    Notes. The Borrowers shall execute and deliver (1) to each Increasing Lender a replacement revolving credit Note reflecting the new amount of such Increasing Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment after giving effect to the increase (and the prior Note issued to such Increasing Lender shall be deemed to be terminated) and (2) to each New Lender a revolving credit Note reflecting the amount of such New Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment. (vi)    Approval of New Lenders. Any New Lender shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). (vii)    Increasing Lenders.

Each New Lender shall execute a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent pursuant to which such New Lender shall join and become a party to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with a Revolving Credit Commitment in the amount set forth in such lender joinder.2.11    Reduction of Revolving Credit Commitment. The Borrowers shall have the right at any time after the Closing Date upon five (5) calendar days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period of time agreed to by the Administrative Agent) to (x) permanently reduce (ratably among the Lenders in proportion to their Ratable Shares) the Revolving Credit Commitments, in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 and whole multiples of $500,000, provided that the total Revolving Commitments after giving effect to any such reduction shall not be less than $100,000,000, or (y) to terminate completely the Revolving Credit Commitments, in each case, without penalty or premium except as set forth herein, including without limitation, in Section 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender], Section 5.8 [Increased Costs] and Section 5.10 [Indemnity]; provided that any such reduction or termination shall be accompanied by prepayment of the Notes, together with outstanding Commitment Fees, and the full amount of interest accrued on the principal sum to be prepaid (and all amounts referred to in Section 5.10 [Indemnity] hereof) to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate Revolving Facility Usage after giving effect to such prepayments to be equal to or less than the Revolving Credit Commitments as so reduced or terminated. Any notice to reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments under this Section 2.11 shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of all Revolving Credit Commitments delivered by the Borrowers may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrowers (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.2.12    Illegality. If, in any applicable jurisdiction, the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any governmental authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to (i) perform any of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (ii) to fund or maintain its participation in any Loan or (iii) issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any Credit Extension, such Person shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, then, upon the Administrative Agent notifying the Borrowers, and until such notice by such Person is revoked, any obligation of such Person to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any such Credit Extension shall be suspended, and to the extent required by applicable Law, cancelled. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall, (A) repay that Person’s participation in the Loans or other applicable Obligations on the last day of the Interest Period for each Loan or other Obligation occurring after the Administrative Agent has notified the Borrowers or, if earlier, the date specified by such Person in the notice delivered to the Administrative Agent (being no earlier than the last day of any applicable grace period permitted by applicable Law) and (B) take all reasonable actions requested by such Person to mitigate or avoid such illegality.3.    RESERVED4.    ARTICLE 4 - INTEREST RATES- 55 -4.1    Interest Rate Options.  The Borrowers shall pay interest in respect of the outstanding unpaid principal amount of the Loans as selected by it from the Base Rate Option or LIBOR Rate Option set forth below applicable to the Loans, it being understood that, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Borrowers may select different Interest Rate Options and different Interest Periods to apply simultaneously to the Loans comprising different Borrowing Tranches and may convert to or renew one or more Interest Rate Options with respect to all or any portion of the Loans comprising any Borrowing Tranche; provided that there shall not be at any one time outstanding more than seven (7) Borrowing Tranches in the aggregate among all of the Loans and provided further that if an Event of Default or Potential Default exists and is continuing, the Borrowers may not request, convert to, or renew the LIBOR Rate Option for any Loans and the Required Lenders may demand that all existing Borrowing Tranches bearing interest under the LIBOR Rate Option shall be converted immediately to the Base Rate Option, subject to the obligation of the Borrowers to pay any indemnity under Section 5.10 [Indemnity] in connection with such conversion. If at any time the designated rate applicable to any Loan made by any Lender exceeds such Lender’s highest lawful rate, the rate of interest on such Lender’s Loan shall be limited to such Lender’s highest lawful rate.4.1.1    Revolving Credit Interest Rate Options; Swing Loan Interest Rate.  The Borrowers shall have the right to select from the following Interest Rate Options applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans:(i)    Revolving Credit Base Rate Option: A fluctuating rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed) equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, such interest rate to change automatically from time to time effective as of the effective date of each change in the Base Rate; or(ii)    Revolving Credit LIBOR Rate Option: A rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed) equal to the LIBOR Rate as determined for each applicable Interest Period, plus the Applicable Margin.(iii)    Swing Loan Interest Rate.    Subject to Section 4.3 [Interest After Default], only the Base Rate Option applicable to Revolving Credit Loans shall apply to the Swing Loans.4.1.2        [RESERVED]4.1.3    Rate Quotations.  The Borrowers may call the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which a Loan Request is to be delivered to receive an indication of the rates then in effect, but it is acknowledged that such projection shall not be binding on the Administrative Agent or the Lenders nor affect the rate of interest which thereafter is actually in effect when the election is made.4.2    Interest Periods.  At any time when the Borrowers shall select, convert to or renew a LIBOR Rate Option, the Borrowers shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such LIBOR Rate Option by delivering a Loan Request. The notice shall specify an Interest Period during which such Interest Rate Option shall - 56 -apply. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the following provisions shall apply to any selection of, renewal of, or conversion to a LIBOR Rate Option:4.2.1    Amount of Borrowing Tranche.  Each Borrowing Tranche of Loans under the LIBOR Rate Option shall be in integral multiples of, and not less than, the respective amounts specified in Section 2.4.1 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests]; and4.2.2    Renewals.  In the case of the renewal of a LIBOR Rate Option at the end of an Interest Period, the first day of the new Interest Period shall be the last day of the preceding Interest Period, without duplication in payment of interest for such day.4.3    Interest After Default.  To the extent permitted by Law, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and until such time such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived, and at the discretion of the Administrative Agent or upon written demand by the Required Lenders to the Administrative Agent:4.3.1    Letter of Credit Fees, Interest Rate.  The Letter of Credit Fees and the rate of interest for each Loan otherwise applicable pursuant to Section 2.8.2 [Letter of Credit Fees] or Section 4.1 [Interest Rate Options], respectively, shall be increased by 2.0% per annum;4.3.2    Other Obligations.  Each other Obligation hereunder if not paid when due shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the rate of interest applicable under the Revolving Credit Base Rate Option plus an additional 2.0% per annum from the time such Obligation becomes due and payable and until it is paid in full; and4.3.3    Acknowledgment.  The Borrowers acknowledge that the increase in rates referred to in this Section 4.3 reflects, among other things, the fact that such Loans or other amounts have become a substantially greater risk given their default status and that the Lenders are entitled to additional compensation for such risk; and all such interest shall be payable by Borrowers upon demand by Administrative Agent.4.4    LIBOR Rate Unascertainable; Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available.4.4.1    Unascertainable.  If on any date on which a LIBOR Rate would otherwise be determined, the Administrative Agent shall have determined that:(i)    adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining such LIBOR Rate, (ii)    a contingency has occurred which materially and adversely affects the London interbank eurodollar market relating to the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent’s and Lender’s Rights], or(iii)    the applicable supervisor or administrator (if any) of the LIBOR Rate or an Official Body having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying the specific date after which the LIBOR Rate shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans (either such date, a “LIBOR Termination Date”), or a rate other than the - 57 -LIBOR Rate has become a widely recognized benchmark rate for newly originated loans in Dollars in the U.S. market, then the Administrative Agent may (in consultation with the Borrowers) choose a replacement index for the LIBOR Rate and make adjustments to applicable margins and related amendments to this Agreement as referred to below such that, to the extent practicable, the all-in interest rate based on the replacement index will be substantially equivalent to the all-in LIBOR Rate-based interest rate in effect prior to its replacement. In such event:(A)    The Administrative Agent and the Borrowers shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect the replacement index, the adjusted margins and such other related amendments as may be appropriate, in the reasonable discretion of the Administrative Agent, for the implementation and administration of the replacement index-based rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, Section 11.2), such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement at 5:00 p.m. on the tenth (10th) Business Day after the date a draft of the amendment is provided to the Lenders, unless the Administrative Agent receives, on or before such tenth (10th) Business Day, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that such Lenders object to such amendment.(B)    Selection of the replacement index, adjustments to the applicable margins, and amendments to this Agreement (I) will be determined with due consideration to the then-current market practices for determining and implementing a rate of interest for newly originated loans in the United States and loans converted from a LIBOR Rate-based rate to a replacement index-based rate, and (II) may also reflect adjustments to account for (x) the effects of the transition from the LIBOR Rate to the replacement index and (y) yield- or risk-based differences between the LIBOR Rate and the replacement index.(C)    Until an amendment reflecting a new replacement index in accordance with this Section 4.4.1(iii) is effective, each advance, conversion and renewal of a Loan to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies will continue to bear interest with reference to the LIBOR Rate; provided however, that if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be final and conclusive, absent manifest error) that a LIBOR Termination Date has occurred, then following the LIBOR Termination Date, all Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies shall automatically be converted to the Base Rate Option until such time as an amendment reflecting a replacement index and related matters as described above is implemented. In the event that the Required Lenders have provided a written notice pursuant to Section 4.4.1(iii)(A) objecting to an amendment, the Lenders agree to work with the Borrowers in good faith to timely determine and implement the replacement index-based rate.(D)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time the replacement index is less than zero, at such times, such index shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of this Agreement.4.4.2    Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available.  If at any time any Lender shall have determined that:- 58 -(i)    the making, maintenance or funding of any Loan to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies has been made impracticable or unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any Law or any interpretation or application thereof by any Official Body or with any request or directive of any such Official Body (whether or not having the force of Law), or(ii)    such LIBOR Rate Option will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lender of the establishment or maintenance of any such Loan, or(iii)    after making all reasonable efforts, deposits of the relevant amount in Dollars for the relevant Interest Period for a Loan, or to banks generally, to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies, respectively, are not available to such Lender with respect to such Loan, or to banks generally, in the interbank eurodollar market, then the Administrative Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent’s and Lender’s Rights].4.4.3    Administrative Agent’s and Lender’s Rights.  In the case of any event specified in Section 4.4.1 [Unascertainable] above, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Lenders and the Borrowers thereof, and in the case of an event specified in Section 4.4.2 [Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available] above, such Lender shall promptly so notify the Administrative Agent and endorse a certificate to such notice as to the specific circumstances of such notice, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly send copies of such notice and certificate to the other Lenders and the Borrowers. Upon such date as shall be specified in such notice (which shall not be earlier than the date such notice is given), the obligation of (A) the Lenders, in the case of such notice given by the Administrative Agent, or (B) such Lender, in the case of such notice given by such Lender, to allow the Borrowers to select, convert to or renew a LIBOR Rate Option shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall have later notified the Borrowers, or such Lender shall have later notified the Administrative Agent, of the Administrative Agent’s or such Lender’s, as the case may be, determination that the circumstances giving rise to such previous determination no longer exist. If at any time the Administrative Agent makes a determination under Section 4.4.1 [Unascertainable] and the Borrowers have previously notified the Administrative Agent of its selection of, conversion to or renewal of a LIBOR Rate Option and such Interest Rate Option has not yet gone into effect, such notification shall be deemed to provide for selection of, conversion to or renewal of the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loans. If any Lender notifies the Administrative Agent of a determination under Section 4.4.2 [Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available], the Borrowers shall, subject to the Borrowers’ indemnification Obligations under Section 5.10 [Indemnity], as to any Loan of the Lender to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies, on the date specified in such notice either convert such Loan to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan or prepay such Loan in accordance with Section 5.6 [Voluntary Prepayments]. Absent due notice from the Borrowers of conversion or prepayment, such Loan shall automatically be converted to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan upon such specified date.4.5    Selection of Interest Rate Options.  If the Borrowers fail to select a new Interest Period to apply to any Borrowing Tranche of Loans under the LIBOR Rate Option at the expiration of an existing Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing Tranche in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.2 [Interest Periods], the Borrowers shall be deemed to have converted such - 59 -Borrowing Tranche to the Base Rate Option commencing upon the last day of the existing Interest Period. If the Borrowers provide any Loan Request related to a Loan at the LIBOR Rate Option but fails to identify an Interest Period therefor, such Loan Request shall be deemed to request an Interest Period of one (1) month. Any Loan Request that fails to select an Interest Rate Option shall be deemed to be a request for the Base Rate Option.5.    PAYMENTS5.1    Payments.  All payments and prepayments to be made in respect of principal, interest, Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, Administrative Agent’s Fee or other fees or amounts due from the Borrowers hereunder shall be payable prior to 1:00 p.m. on the date when due without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers, and without set-off, counterclaim or other deduction of any nature, and an action therefor shall immediately accrue. Such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Principal Office for the account of Swing Loan Lender with respect to the Swing Loans and for the ratable accounts of the Lenders with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans in U.S. Dollars and in immediately available funds, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute such amounts to the Lenders in immediately available funds; provided that in the event payments are received by 1:00 p.m. by the Administrative Agent with respect to the Loans and such payments are not distributed to the Lenders on the same day received by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall pay the Lenders the Effective Federal Funds Rate with respect to the amount of such payments for each day held by the Administrative Agent and not distributed to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent’s and each Lender’s statement of account, ledger or other relevant record shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive as the statement of the amount of principal of and interest on the Loans and other amounts owing under this Agreement and shall be deemed an “account stated.”5.2    Pro Rata Treatment of Lenders.  Each borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans shall be allocated to each Lender according to its Ratable Share, and each selection of, conversion to or renewal of any Interest Rate Option and each payment or prepayment by the Borrowers with respect to principal, interest, Commitment Fees and Letter of Credit Fees (but excluding the Administrative Agent’s Fee and the Issuing Lender’s fronting fee) shall (except as otherwise may be provided with respect to a Defaulting Lender and except as provided in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent’s and Lender’s Rights] in the case of an event specified in Section 4.4 [LIBOR Rate Unascertainable; Etc.], 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender] or 5.8 [Increased Costs]) be payable ratably among the Lenders entitled to such payment in accordance with the amount of principal, interest, Commitment Fees and Letter of Credit Fees, as set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each borrowing or payment or prepayment by the Borrowers of principal, interest, fees or other amounts from the Borrowers with respect to Swing Loans shall be made by or to Swing Loan Lender according to Section 2.5.5 [Borrowings to Repay Swing Loans].5.3    Sharing of Payments by Lenders.  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff, counterclaim or banker’s lien, by receipt of voluntary payment, by realization upon security, or by any other non-pro rata source, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender’s receiving payment of a - 60 -proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than the pro-rata share of the amount such Lender is entitled thereto, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:(i)    if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, together with interest or other amounts, if any, required by Law (including court order) to be paid by the Lender or the holder making such purchase; and(ii)    the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Loan Parties pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of the Loan Documents or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or Participation Advances to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrowers or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall apply).Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation but without duplication as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Loan Party in the amount of such participation.5.4    Presumptions by Administrative Agent.  (i)    Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender (x) in the case of Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies 4 hours prior to the proposed time of such Borrowing Tranche of Loans and (y) otherwise, prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing Tranche of Loans that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s Ratable Share, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.5.1 [Making Revolving Credit Loans] or Section 2.8.7 [Nature of Participation and Reimbursement Obligations] and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing Tranche of Loans available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrowers to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Effective Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrowers, the interest rate applicable to Loans under the Base Rate Option. If the Borrowers and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping - 61 -period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrowers the amount of such interest paid by the Borrowers for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing Tranche of Loans to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing Tranche of Loans. Any payment by the Borrowers shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrowers may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.(ii)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Effective Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.5.5    Interest Payment Dates.  Interest on Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies shall be due and payable in arrears on each Payment Date. Interest on Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies shall be due and payable on the last day of each Interest Period for those Loans (and, if such Interest Period is longer than three (3) Months, also on the 90th and 180th day of such Interest Period). Interest on the principal amount of each Loan or other monetary Obligation shall be due and payable on demand after such principal amount or other monetary Obligation becomes due and payable (whether on the stated Expiration Date, upon acceleration or otherwise).5.6    Voluntary Prepayments.5.6.1    Right to Prepay.  The Borrowers shall have the right at its option from time to time to prepay the Loans in whole or part without premium or penalty (except as provided in Section 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender] below, in Section 5.8 [Increased Costs] and Section 5.10 [Indemnity]). Whenever the Borrowers desire to prepay any part of the Loans, it shall provide a prepayment notice to the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of prepayment of the Revolving Credit Loans or no later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of prepayment of Swing Loans, setting forth the following information:(w)    the date, which shall be a Business Day, on which the proposed prepayment is to be made;(x)    a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between the Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Loans;(y)    a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies and Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies; and- 62 -(z)    the total principal amount of such prepayment, which shall not be less than the lesser of (i) the Revolving Facility Usage or (ii) $500,000 for any Swing Loan or $500,000 for any Revolving Credit Loan.All prepayment notices shall be irrevocable; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of all Revolving Credit Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.11 [Reduction of Revolving Credit Commitment], then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.11 [Reduction of Revolving Credit Commitment]. The principal amount of the Loans for which a prepayment notice is given, together with interest on such principal amount except with respect to Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, shall be due and payable on the date specified in such prepayment notice as the date on which the proposed prepayment is to be made. Except as provided in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent’s and Lender’s Rights], if the Borrowers prepay a Loan but fail to specify the applicable Borrowing Tranche which the Borrowers are prepaying, the prepayment shall be applied first to Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, then to Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies. Any prepayment hereunder shall be subject to the Borrowers’ Obligation to indemnify the Lenders under Section 5.10 [Indemnity].5.6.2    Replacement of a Lender.  In the event any Lender (i) gives notice under Section 4.4 [LIBOR Rate Unascertainable, Etc.], (ii) requests compensation under Section 5.8 [Increased Costs], or requires the Borrowers to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Official Body for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.9 [Taxes], (iii) is a Defaulting Lender, (iv) becomes subject to the control of an Official Body (other than normal and customary supervision), or (v) is a Non-Consenting Lender referred to in Section 11.2 [Modifications, Amendments or Waivers], then in any such event the Borrowers may, at their sole expense, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.9 [Successors and Assigns]), all of its interests, rights (other than existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 5.8 [Increased Costs] or 5.9 [Taxes]) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:(i)    the Borrowers shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 11.9 [Successors and Assigns];(ii)    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and Participation Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 5.10 [Indemnity]) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts);(iii)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 5.8.1 [Increased Costs Generally] or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 5.9 [Taxes], such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; - 63 -(iv)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable Law; and(v)    in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrowers to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.5.7    Reserved.5.8    Increased Costs.5.8.1    Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall: (i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the LIBOR Rate) or the Issuing Lender; (ii)    subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (ii) through (iv) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or(iii)    impose on any Lender, the Issuing Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, the Issuing Lender or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, the Issuing Lender or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Issuing Lender or other Recipient, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender, the Issuing Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 5.8.2    Capital Requirements.  If any Lender or the Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the Issuing Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s holding company, - 64 -if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 5.8.3    Certificates for Reimbursement; Repayment of Outstanding Loans; Borrowing of New Loans.

The Borrowers shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. 5.8.4    Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrowers of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the one hundred eighty (180) calendar day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).5.9    Taxes. 5.9.1    Issuing Lender.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 5.9.5    Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of any of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.9.4 [Participations] relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register, and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Official Body.

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party incurred in connection with obtaining such refund, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 5.9.8 [Treatment of Certain Refunds] (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Official Body) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Official Body. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.9.8 [Treatment of Certain Refunds]), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 5.9.8 [Treatment of Certain Refunds] the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.

On such Settlement Date, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent the amount equal to the difference between its Required Share and its Revolving Credit Loans, and the Administrative Agent shall pay to each Lender its Ratable Share of all payments made by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans. The Administrative Agent shall also effect settlement in accordance with the foregoing sentence on the proposed Borrowing Dates for Revolving Credit Loans and on any mandatory prepayment date as provided for herein and may at its option effect settlement on any other Business Day. These settlement procedures are established solely as a matter of administrative convenience, and nothing contained in this Section 5.11 shall relieve the Lenders of their obligations to fund Revolving Credit Loans on dates other than a Settlement Date pursuant to Section 2.1.2 [Swing Loan Commitment]. The Administrative Agent may at any time at its option for any reason whatsoever require each Lender to pay immediately to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s Ratable Share of the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and each Lender may at any time require the Administrative Agent to pay immediately to such Lender its Ratable Share of all payments made by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans.5.12    Mitigation Obligations. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 5.8, or the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Official Body for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.9, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or materially reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.8 or 5.9, as the case may be, in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense, (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect and (iv) would not require such Lender to take any action inconsistent with its internal policies or legal or regulatory restrictions. The - 70 -Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.5.13    Cash Collateral. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one (1) Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) the Borrowers shall Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lender’s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 2.9(i)(D) [Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure] and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount.(i)    Grant of Security Interest. The Borrowers, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Lender, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lenders’ obligation to fund participations in respect of Letter of Credit Obligations, to be applied pursuant to clause (b) below. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender as herein provided or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrowers will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).(ii)    Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 5.13 or Section 2.9 [Defaulting Lender] in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender’s obligation to fund participations in respect of Letter of Credit Obligations (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.(iii)    Termination of Requirement. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce the Issuing Lender’s Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 5.13 following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to Section 2.9 [Default Lenders], the Person providing Cash Collateral and the Issuing Lender may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations and provided further that to the extent that such Cash Collateral was provided by the Borrowers, such Cash Collateral shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to Section 5.13(i) above.6.    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES- 71 -6.1    Representations and Warranties.

The provisions of this Section 10 are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, and neither the Borrowers nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.10.2    Rights as a Lender.  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.10.3    Exculpatory Provisions.  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:- 99 -(a)    shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Potential Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;(b)    shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and(c)    shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrowers or any of their Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 11.2 [Modifications, Amendments or Waivers] and 9.2 [Consequences of Event of Default]) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Potential Default or Event of Default unless and until notice describing such Potential Default or Event of Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrowers, a Lender or the Issuing Lender.The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Potential Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 7 [Conditions of Lending and Issuance of Letters of Credit] or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.10.4    Reliance by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon - 100 -any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the Issuing Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.10.5    Delegation of Duties.

(i)     The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Lender and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with approval from the Borrowers (so long as no Potential Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Resignation Effective Date”), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications specified above; provided that in no event shall any such successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.(ii)    If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrowers and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, with approval from the Borrowers, appoint a successor, such approval not to be - 101 -unreasonably withheld or delayed. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Removal Effective Date”), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.(iii)    With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (i) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and Issuing Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor.

The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain a record of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time. Such register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is in such register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. Such register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.11.9.4    Participations.

The Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.4 [Libor Rate Unascertainable, Etc.], 5.8 [Increased Costs], 5.10 [Indemnity] and 5.9 [Taxes] (subject to the - 115 -requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 5.9.7 [Status of Lenders] (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 5.9.7 [Status of Lenders] shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 11.8.2 [Assignments by Lenders]; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender] as if it were an assignee under Section 11.8.2 [Assignments by Lenders]; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 5.8 [Increased Costs] or 5.9 [Taxes], with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrowers to effectuate the provisions of Section 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender] with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.2.3 [Set-off] as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 5.3 [Sharing of Payments by Lenders] as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.11.9.5    Certain Pledges; Successors and Assigns Generally.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 11.10    Confidentiality.11.10.1    General.

Leases with an original term of twelve months or less are not reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheet; expense for these short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br/></span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Many leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that if exercised by us, extend the lease term from one to </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>10</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> years. The exercise of these renewal options is at the Company’s discretion. When assessing the likelihood of a renewal or termination, the Company considers the significance of leasehold improvements, availability of alternative locations, and the cost of relocation or replacement, among other considerations. The depreciable lives of leasehold improvements are the shorter of the useful lives of the improvements or the expected lease term. The Company determines the lease term for each lease based on the terms of each contract and factors in renewal and early termination options if such options are reasonably certain to be exercised.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br/></span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Due to the Company’s centralized treasury function, the Company utilizes a portfolio approach to discount its lease obligations. The Company assesses the expected lease term at lease inception and discounts the lease using a fully-secured annual incremental borrowing rate, adjusted for time value corresponding with the expected lease term. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br/></span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Certain of our retail store leases include rental payments based upon a percentage of retail sales in excess of a minimum fixed rental. In some cases, there is no fixed minimum rental and the entire rental payment is based upon a percentage of sales. Certain of our warehouse leases have rental payments that vary based upon the volume of product placed in storage. In addition, certain leases include rental payments adjusted periodically for changes in price level indexes. We recognize expense for these types of payments as incurred and report them as variable lease expense.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span

The exercise of these renewal options is at the Company’s discretion. When assessing the likelihood of a renewal or termination, the Company considers the significance of leasehold improvements, availability of alternative locations, and the cost of relocation or replacement, among other considerations. The depreciable lives of leasehold improvements are the shorter of the useful lives of the improvements or the expected lease term. The Company determines the lease term for each lease based on the terms of each contract and factors in renewal and early termination options if such options are reasonably certain to be exercised.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br/></span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Due to the Company’s centralized treasury function, the Company utilizes a portfolio approach to discount its lease obligations.

The fair values of these assets are determined based on Level 3 measurements, including estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows based upon historical experience, expected market conditions, and management’s plans. 100000 700000 300000 1200000 <span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;"> </span><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company transacts business in various foreign countries and is therefore exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk that impacts the reported U.S. Dollar amounts of revenues, expenses, and certain foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. In order to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency and to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company enters into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currency. By policy, the Company does not enter into these contracts for trading purposes or speculation. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br/></span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Counterparty default risk is considered low because the forward contracts that the Company enters into are over-the-counter instruments transacted with highly-rated financial institutions.

The Company reports derivative instruments with the same counterparty on a net basis when a master netting arrangement is in place. Changes in fair value are recognized within ‘Foreign currency gains (losses), net’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company classifies cash flows from derivative instruments at settlement in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items within ‘Cash provided by operating activities.’</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span

the “Credit Agreement”), with the lenders named therein and PNC Bank, National Association, as a lender and administrative agent for the lenders. The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict certain actions by the Company, including limitations on: (i) stock repurchases to an aggregate of </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>$250.0 million</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> per fiscal year, subject to certain restrictions; and (ii) capital expenditures and commitments to </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>$70.0 million</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> per year. The Credit Agreement also permits intercompany loans of up to </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>$375.0 million</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and requires the Company to meet certain financial covenant ratios that become effective when average outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, including letters of credit, exceed the lesser of </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>$40.0 million</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> or </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>40%</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> of the total commitments during certain periods or if the outstanding borrowings exceed the borrowing base.

style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the increase in the effective tax rate, compared to the same period in 2018, was driven primarily by tax expense recorded in profitable jurisdictions, partially offset by operating losses in jurisdictions for which the Company has determined it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits and the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions. The Company’s effective income tax rate, for each period presented, also differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate primarily due to differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, as well as operating losses in certain jurisdictions for which tax benefits cannot be recognized.

subjected to an audit by the Brazilian Federal Tax Authorities related to imports of footwear from China between 2010 and 2014. On January 13, 2015, the Company was notified about the issuance of assessments totaling </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>14.4 million</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> Brazilian Real (“BRL”), or approximately </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>$3.7 million</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, plus interest and penalties, for the period January 2010 through May 2011. The Company has disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to the claims. On February 25, 2015, the Company received additional assessments totaling </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>33.3 million</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> BRL, or approximately </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>$8.6 million</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, plus interest and penalties, related to the remainder of the audit period. The Company has also disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to these claims in administrative appeals. On August 29, 2017, the Company received a favorable ruling on its appeal of the first assessment, which dismissed all fines, penalties, and interest. The tax authorities have appealed that decision and Crocs has challenged the appeal on both the merits and procedure. Should the Brazilian Tax Authority prevail in this final administrative appeal, Crocs may still challenge the assessments through the court system, which would likely require the posting of a bond. Additionally, the second appeal for the remaining assessments was heard on March 22, 2018. That decision was partially favorable and resulted in an approximately </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>38%</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> reduction in principal, penalties, and interest, leaving approximately </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>$5.3 million</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, plus interest and penalties, at risk for those assessments. The tax authorities have appealed that decision and Crocs has filed a response to the tax authorities’ appeal as well as a separate appeal against the unfavorable portion of the ruling.

The Company is engaged in the design, development, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children. We strive to be the global leader in the sale of molded footwear characterized by functionality, comfort, color, and lightweight design. Our reportable operating segments include: the Americas, operating in North and South America; Asia Pacific, operating throughout Asia, Australia, and New Zealand; and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), operating throughout Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Africa. In the third quarter of 2018, certain revenues and expenses previously reported within the ‘Asia Pacific’ segment were shifted to the ‘EMEA’ segment. See Note 14 — Operating Segments and Geographic Information for additional information. The previously reported amounts for revenues and income from operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and reflect all adjustments which are necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Such unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (“Annual Report”), and have been prepared on a consistent basis with the accounting policies described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report. Our accounting policies did not change during the six months ended June 30, 2019, other than for the new accounting pronouncements adopted as described in Note 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” within Part I - Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.ReclassificationsIn addition to the shift in certain revenues and expenses previously reported within the ‘Asia Pacific’ and ‘EMEA’ segments described above, the Company has reclassified certain amounts on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows to conform to current period presentation. Seasonality of BusinessDue to the seasonal nature of our footwear, which is more heavily focused on styles suitable for warm weather, revenues generated during our fourth quarter, when the northern hemisphere is experiencing cooler weather, are typically less than revenues generated during our first three quarters. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including the timing of new model introductions, general economic conditions, and consumer confidence. Accordingly, results of operations and cash flows for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of expected results for any other quarter or for any other year.Transactions with AffiliatesThe Company receives services from three affiliates of Blackstone Capital Partners VI L.P. (“Blackstone”). Blackstone and certain of its permitted transferees beneficially owned 6,896,548 shares of the Company’s common stock as of June 30, 2019. Blackstone also has the future right to designate for nomination one director to our Board, and currently has two designees serving on the Board.Certain Blackstone affiliates provide various services to the Company, including inventory count services, cybersecurity and consulting, and workforce management services. The Company incurred expenses for services from these affiliates of $0.3 million for both of the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, and $1.0 million and $0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Expenses related to these services are reported in ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

This guidance may be adopted retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the income tax effects of the Tax Act related to items remaining in AOCI are recognized, or at the beginning of the period of adoption. The guidance became effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. This guidance became effective during the first quarter of 2019; however, the Company did not elect to make the optional reclassification. Our policy is to release stranded tax effects from AOCI using either a specific identification approach or portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item.LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to accounting for leases. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the guidance using the modified retrospective method applied as of the date of adoption. The comparative information presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements was not restated and is reported under the accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. The Company has elected all of the available transition practical expedients, including the ‘package of practical expedients’, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company has elected not to apply ‘hindsight’ when adopting the standard for determining the reasonably certain lease term and in assessing impairments. The Company has elected the short-term lease exemption, which means the Company has not and will not recognize a right-of-use asset or liability for leases that qualify for the short-term exemption and will recognize those lease expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term in its condensed consolidated statements of operations. Further, the Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components for all of its leases.Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and liabilities of approximately $176.1 million and $187.4 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2019, with additional adjustments to ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’, ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’, and ‘Retained earnings’. As a result of the adoption of new lease accounting standards, the Company assessed the initial right-of-use assets for impairment and recorded non-cash impairments of $0.2 million within ‘Retained earnings’ in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the condensed consolidated statements of operations or cash flows.New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedImplementation Costs Incurred in Cloud Computing ArrangementsIn August 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to the treatment of implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is considered a service contract. This guidance becomes effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those periods, with early adoption permitted, and will be applied prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. Other PronouncementsOther new pronouncements issued but not effective until after June 30, 2019 are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

The comparative information presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements was not restated and is reported under the accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. See ‘Leases’ in Note 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements for a discussion of the significant changes resulting from adoption of the guidance.The Company’s lease portfolio consists primarily of real estate assets, which includes retail, warehouse, distribution center, and office spaces, under operating leases expiring at various dates through 2033. Leases with an original term of twelve months or less are not reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheet; expense for these short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.Many leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that if exercised by us, extend the lease term from one to 10 years. The exercise of these renewal options is at the Company’s discretion. When assessing the likelihood of a renewal or termination, the Company considers the significance of leasehold improvements, availability of alternative locations, and the cost of relocation or replacement, among other considerations. The depreciable lives of leasehold improvements are the shorter of the useful lives of the improvements or the expected lease term. The Company determines the lease term for each lease based on the terms of each contract and factors in renewal and early termination options if such options are reasonably certain to be exercised.Due to the Company’s centralized treasury function, the Company utilizes a portfolio approach to discount its lease obligations. The Company assesses the expected lease term at lease inception and discounts the lease using a fully-secured annual incremental borrowing rate, adjusted for time value corresponding with the expected lease term. Certain of our retail store leases include rental payments based upon a percentage of retail sales in excess of a minimum fixed rental. In some cases, there is no fixed minimum rental and the entire rental payment is based upon a percentage of sales.

In order to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency and to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company enters into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currency. By policy, the Company does not enter into these contracts for trading purposes or speculation. Counterparty default risk is considered low because the forward contracts that the Company enters into are over-the-counter instruments transacted with highly-rated financial institutions. The Company was not required to and did not post collateral as of June 30, 2019 or December 31, 2018.The Company’s derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company reports derivative instruments with the same counterparty on a net basis when a master netting arrangement is in place. Changes in fair value are recognized within ‘Foreign currency gains (losses), net’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company classifies cash flows from derivative instruments at settlement in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items within ‘Cash provided by operating activities.’Results of Derivative ActivitiesThe fair values of derivative assets and liabilities, net, all of which are classified as Level 2, reported within ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheets were: June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Derivative Assets Derivative Liabilities Derivative Assets Derivative Liabilities (in thousands)Forward foreign currency exchange contracts$862 $(1,371) $943 $(2,256)Netting of counterparty contracts(862) 862 (943) 943  Foreign currency forward contract derivatives$— $(509) $— $(1,313)The notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts presented below report the total U.S. Dollar equivalent position and the net contract fair values for each foreign currency position. June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Notional Fair Value Notional Fair Value (in thousands)Euro$35,271 $116 $34,959 $(92)Singapore Dollar38,735 16 34,584 254Japanese Yen27,737 (732) 25,561 (178)British Pound Sterling9,952 145 22,185 183South Korean Won15,257 195 9,408 63Other currencies40,351 (249) 67,885 (1,543)Total$167,303 $(509) $194,582 $(1,313)        Latest maturity dateJuly 2019 January 2019Amounts reported in ‘Foreign currency gains (losses), net’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations include both realized and unrealized gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions and derivative contracts, and were: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 (in thousands)Foreign currency transaction gains (losses)$525 $(563) $(908) $488Foreign currency forward exchange contracts gains (losses)(786) 846 (570) 866Foreign currency gains (losses), net$(261) $283 $(1,478) $1,354 X - ReferencesNo definition available. + Details Name: us-gaap_DerivativeInstrumentsAndHedgingActivitiesDisclosureAbstract Namespace Prefix: us-gaap_ Data Type: xbrli:stringItemType Balance Type: na Period Type: duration X - DefinitionThe entire disclosure for derivative instruments and hedging activities including, but not limited to, risk management strategies, non-hedging derivative instruments, assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and methodologies and assumptions used in determining the amounts. + ReferencesReference 1: http://fasb.org/us-gaap/role/ref/legacyRef -Publisher FASB -Name Accounting Standards Codification -Topic 815 -URI http://asc.fasb.org/topic&trid=2229140 + Details Name: us-gaap_DerivativeInstrumentsAndHedgingActivitiesDisclosureTextBlock Namespace Prefix: us-gaap_ Data Type: nonnum:textBlockItemType Balance Type: na Period Type: duration XML 26 R15.htm IDEA: XBRL DOCUMENT /* Do Not Remove This Comment */ function toggleNextSibling (e) { if (e.nextSibling.style.display=='none') { e.nextSibling.style.display='block'; } else { e.nextSibling.style.display='none'; } } v3.19.2 Revolving Credit Facilities and Bank Borrowings 6 Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 Debt Disclosure [Abstract]   Revolving Credit Facilities and Bank Borrowings REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES AND BANK BORROWINGS  The Company’s borrowings were as follows: June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 (in thousands)Revolving credit facilities$215,000 $120,000Less: Current portion of borrowings— —Total long-term borrowings$215,000 $120,000Senior Revolving Credit FacilityIn December 2011, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility (the “Facility”), pursuant to an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), with the lenders named therein and PNC Bank, National Association, as a lender and administrative agent for the lenders. The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict certain actions by the Company, including limitations on: (i) stock repurchases to an aggregate of $250.0 million per fiscal year, subject to certain restrictions; and (ii) capital expenditures and commitments to $70.0 million per year. The Credit Agreement also permits intercompany loans of up to $375.0 million and requires the Company to meet certain financial covenant ratios that become effective when average outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, including letters of credit, exceed the lesser of $40.0 million or 40% of the total commitments during certain periods or if the outstanding borrowings exceed the borrowing base. If the financial covenant ratios are in effect, the Company must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of (i) 2.75 to 1.00 at June 30, 2019, (ii) 2.50 to 1.00 at September 30, 2019, and the last day of each quarter thereafter. As of June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.As of June 30, 2019, the total commitments available from the lenders under the Facility were $300.0 million. At June 30, 2019, the Company had $215.0 million in outstanding borrowings, which are due in February 2021, and $4.6 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Facility, which reduces amounts available for borrowing under the Facility. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had $80.4 million and $129.4 million, respectively, of available borrowing capacity under the Facility.The Company also has a revolving credit facility in Asia, under which the Company had no borrowings during the six months ended June 30, 2019 and year ended December 31, 2018 or borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.Amended Senior Revolving Credit FacilityOn July 26, 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (the “Borrowers”) entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Restated Credit Agreement”) with the lenders named therein and PNC Bank, National Association, as a lender and administrative agent. The Restated Credit Agreement replaces the Credit Agreement described above.The Restated Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $450.0 million, which can be increased by an additional $150.0 million subject to certain conditions, and the Restated Credit Agreement will mature on July 26, 2024. Borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate based on a domestic base rate or a LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.875% based on the Company’s leverage ratio.Among other things, the Restated Credit Agreement amended the prior Credit Agreement to (i) require the Company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 4.00 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 from September 30, 2019 to September 30, 2020, decreasing to 3.25 to 1.00 from December 31, 2020 and thereafter (subject to an increase to 4.00 to 1.00 in the event of certain permitted acquisitions or stock repurchases); (ii) allow stock repurchases so long as after giving effect to such stock repurchases, the maximum leverage ratio does not exceed the applicable maximum leverage ratio, less 0.25; (iii) allow permitted acquisitions so long as there is borrowing availability under the Restated Credit Agreement of at least $40.0 million; and (iv) amend certain other covenants and provisions to be more favorable to the Borrowers. Except as described above, the other material terms of the Restated Credit Agreement are substantially the same as the prior Credit Agreement.Borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement are secured by all of the assets of the Borrowers, and guaranteed by certain other subsidiaries of the Borrowers.

The Company’s effective income tax rate, for each period presented, also differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate primarily due to differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, as well as operating losses in certain jurisdictions for which tax benefits cannot be recognized. There were no significant or unusual discrete tax items during the six months ended June 30, 2019. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $4.4 million and $4.5 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and the Company does not expect any significant changes in tax benefits in the next twelve months.During the six months ended June 30, 2019, income tax expense decreased $2.7 million compared to the same period in 2018. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was 14.8% compared to an effective tax rate of 21.3% for the same period in 2018, a 6.5% decrease. This decrease in the effective rate was due to operating losses in jurisdictions for which the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits, partially offset by tax expense recorded in profitable jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate of 14.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate due to differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions as well as book losses in certain jurisdictions for which tax benefits cannot be recognized.Our tax rate is volatile and may increase or decrease with changes in, among other things, the amount of income or loss by jurisdiction, our ability to utilize net operating losses and foreign tax credits, changes in tax laws, and the movement of liabilities established pursuant to accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions as statutes of limitations expire, positions are effectively settled, or when additional information becomes available. There are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions and other changes to regulatory environments in countries in which we do business that, if enacted, may have an impact on our effective tax rate.

In addition, the ‘Other businesses’ category aggregates insignificant operating segments that do not meet the reportable segment threshold, including corporate operations and company-operated manufacturing facilities, which substantially ceased operations in the third quarter of 2018.Each of the reportable operating segments derives its revenues from the sale of footwear and accessories to external customers. Revenues for ‘Other businesses’ include non-footwear and accessories product sales to external customers that are excluded from the measurement of segment operating revenues and income. Segment performance is evaluated based on segment results without allocating corporate expenses, or indirect general, administrative, and other expenses. Segment profits or losses include adjustments to eliminate inter-segment sales. Reconciling items between segment income from operations and income from operations consist of other businesses and unallocated corporate and other expenses, as well as inter-segment eliminations.

On January 13, 2015, the Company was notified about the issuance of assessments totaling 14.4 million Brazilian Real (“BRL”), or approximately $3.7 million, plus interest and penalties, for the period January 2010 through May 2011. The Company has disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to the claims. On February 25, 2015, the Company received additional assessments totaling 33.3 million BRL, or approximately $8.6 million, plus interest and penalties, related to the remainder of the audit period. The Company has also disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to these claims in administrative appeals. On August 29, 2017, the Company received a favorable ruling on its appeal of the first assessment, which dismissed all fines, penalties, and interest. The tax authorities have appealed that decision and Crocs has challenged the appeal on both the merits and procedure. Should the Brazilian Tax Authority prevail in this final administrative appeal, Crocs may still challenge the assessments through the court system, which would likely require the posting of a bond. Additionally, the second appeal for the remaining assessments was heard on March 22, 2018. That decision was partially favorable and resulted in an approximately 38% reduction in principal, penalties, and interest, leaving approximately $5.3 million, plus interest and penalties, at risk for those assessments. The tax authorities have appealed that decision and Crocs has filed a response to the tax authorities’ appeal as well as a separate appeal against the unfavorable portion of the ruling. We have not recorded these items within the condensed consolidated financial statements as it is not possible at this time to predict the timing or outcome of this matter or to estimate a potential amount of loss, if any.For all other claims and disputes, where the Company is able to estimate reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses, the Company estimates that as of June 30, 2019, reasonably possible losses associated with these claims and other disputes could potentially exceed amounts accrued by up to $0.6 million.Although the Company is subject to other litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including employment, intellectual property and product liability claims, the Company is not party to any other pending legal proceedings that it believes would reasonably have a material adverse impact on its business, financial results, and cash flows.

The Company is engaged in the design, development, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children. We strive to be the global leader in the sale of molded footwear characterized by functionality, comfort, color, and lightweight design. Segment Reporting Our reportable operating segments include: the Americas, operating in North and South America; Asia Pacific, operating throughout Asia, Australia, and New Zealand; and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), operating throughout Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Africa. In the third quarter of 2018, certain revenues and expenses previously reported within the ‘Asia Pacific’ segment were shifted to the ‘EMEA’ segment. See Note 14 — Operating Segments and Geographic Information for additional information. The previously reported amounts for revenues and income from operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 have been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and reflect all adjustments which are necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Such unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (“Annual Report”), and have been prepared on a consistent basis with the accounting policies described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report. Reclassifications ReclassificationsIn addition to the shift in certain revenues and expenses previously reported within the ‘Asia Pacific’ and ‘EMEA’ segments described above, the Company has reclassified certain amounts on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows to conform to current period presentation. Seasonality of Business Seasonality of BusinessDue to the seasonal nature of our footwear, which is more heavily focused on styles suitable for warm weather, revenues generated during our fourth quarter, when the northern hemisphere is experiencing cooler weather, are typically less than revenues generated during our first three quarters. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including the timing of new model introductions, general economic conditions, and consumer confidence. Accordingly, results of operations and cash flows for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of expected results for any other quarter or for any other year. Transactions with Affiliates Transactions with AffiliatesThe Company receives services from three affiliates of Blackstone Capital Partners VI L.P. (“Blackstone”). Blackstone and certain of its permitted transferees beneficially owned 6,896,548 shares of the Company’s common stock as of June 30, 2019. Blackstone also has the future right to designate for nomination one director to our Board, and currently has two designees serving on the Board.Certain Blackstone affiliates provide various services to the Company, including inventory count services, cybersecurity and consulting, and workforce management services. The Company incurred expenses for services from these affiliates of $0.3 million for both of the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, and $1.0 million and $0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Expenses related to these services are reported in ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements New Accounting Pronouncement AdoptedReclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeIn February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued authoritative guidance that permits reclassification of the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act (“Tax Act”) on accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to retained earnings. This guidance may be adopted retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the income tax effects of the Tax Act related to items remaining in AOCI are recognized, or at the beginning of the period of adoption. The guidance became effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. This guidance became effective during the first quarter of 2019; however, the Company did not elect to make the optional reclassification. Our policy is to release stranded tax effects from AOCI using either a specific identification approach or portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item.LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to accounting for leases. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the guidance using the modified retrospective method applied as of the date of adoption. The comparative information presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements was not restated and is reported under the accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. The Company has elected all of the available transition practical expedients, including the ‘package of practical expedients’, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company has elected not to apply ‘hindsight’ when adopting the standard for determining the reasonably certain lease term and in assessing impairments. The Company has elected the short-term lease exemption, which means the Company has not and will not recognize a right-of-use asset or liability for leases that qualify for the short-term exemption and will recognize those lease expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term in its condensed consolidated statements of operations. Further, the Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components for all of its leases.Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and liabilities of approximately $176.1 million and $187.4 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2019, with additional adjustments to ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’, ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’, and ‘Retained earnings’. As a result of the adoption of new lease accounting standards, the Company assessed the initial right-of-use assets for impairment and recorded non-cash impairments of $0.2 million within ‘Retained earnings’ in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the condensed consolidated statements of operations or cash flows.New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedImplementation Costs Incurred in Cloud Computing ArrangementsIn August 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to the treatment of implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is considered a service contract. This guidance becomes effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those periods, with early adoption permitted, and will be applied prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. Other PronouncementsOther new pronouncements issued but not effective until after June 30, 2019 are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Leases The Company’s lease portfolio consists primarily of real estate assets, which includes retail, warehouse, distribution center, and office spaces, under operating leases expiring at various dates through 2033. Leases with an original term of twelve months or less are not reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheet; expense for these short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.Many leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that if exercised by us, extend the lease term from one to 10 years. The exercise of these renewal options is at the Company’s discretion. When assessing the likelihood of a renewal or termination, the Company considers the significance of leasehold improvements, availability of alternative locations, and the cost of relocation or replacement, among other considerations. The depreciable lives of leasehold improvements are the shorter of the useful lives of the improvements or the expected lease term. The Company determines the lease term for each lease based on the terms of each contract and factors in renewal and early termination options if such options are reasonably certain to be exercised.Due to the Company’s centralized treasury function, the Company utilizes a portfolio approach to discount its lease obligations. The Company assesses the expected lease term at lease inception and discounts the lease using a fully-secured annual incremental borrowing rate, adjusted for time value corresponding with the expected lease term. Certain of our retail store leases include rental payments based upon a percentage of retail sales in excess of a minimum fixed rental. In some cases, there is no fixed minimum rental and the entire rental payment is based upon a percentage of sales. Certain of our warehouse leases have rental payments that vary based upon the volume of product placed in storage. In addition, certain leases include rental payments adjusted periodically for changes in price level indexes. We recognize expense for these types of payments as incurred and report them as variable lease expense. Fair Value of Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities The Company’s non-financial assets, which primarily consist of property and equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets, are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying value. The fair values of these assets are determined based on Level 3 measurements, including estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows based upon historical experience, expected market conditions, and management’s plans. Derivatives Financial Instruments The Company’s derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company reports derivative instruments with the same counterparty on a net basis when a master netting arrangement is in place. Changes in fair value are recognized within ‘Foreign currency gains (losses), net’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company classifies cash flows from derivative instruments at settlement in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items within ‘Cash provided by operating activities.

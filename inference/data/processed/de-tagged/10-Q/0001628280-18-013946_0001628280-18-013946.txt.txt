AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Unless otherwise noted in this report, any description of the “Company,” “Crocs,” “we,” “us,” or “our” includes Crocs, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries within our reportable operating segments and corporate operations. The Company is engaged in the design, development, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children. We strive to be the global leader in the sale of molded footwear characterized by functionality, comfort, color, and lightweight design. Our reportable operating segments include: the Americas, operating in North and South America; Asia Pacific, operating throughout Asia, Australia, and New Zealand; and Europe, operating throughout Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Russia, Africa, and the Middle East. In the third quarter of 2018, certain revenues and expenses previously reported within the ‘Asia Pacific’ segment were shifted to the ‘Europe’ segment. See Note 13 — Operating Segments and Geographic Information for additional information. The previously reported amounts for revenues and income from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and reflect all adjustments which are necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Such unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (“Annual Report”), and have been prepared on a consistent basis with the accounting policies described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report. Our accounting policies did not change during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, other than for the change in accounting principle described in “Inventories” below and the new accounting pronouncements adopted as described in Note 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements.Seasonality of BusinessDue to the seasonal nature of our footwear, which is more heavily focused on styles suitable for warm weather, revenues generated during our fourth quarter are typically less than revenues generated during our first three quarters, when the northern hemisphere is experiencing warmer weather. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including the timing of new model introductions, general economic conditions, and consumer confidence. Accordingly, results of operations and cash flows for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of expected results for any other quarter or for any other year.Transactions with AffiliatesThe Company receives services from three subsidiaries of Blackstone Capital Partners VI L.P. (“Blackstone”). Blackstone and certain of its permitted transferees currently beneficially own all the outstanding shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”), which is convertible into approximately 13.8 million shares, or 17.0%, of the Company’s common stock as of September 30, 2018. Blackstone also has the right to nominate two representatives to serve on the Company’s Board of Directors.Certain Blackstone subsidiaries provide various services to the Company, including inventory count services, cybersecurity and consulting, and workforce management services. The Company paid $0.1 million for each of the three month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $0.5 million and $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for these services. Expenses related to these services are reported in ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.5Table of ContentsRestricted CashRestricted cash primarily consists of funds to secure certain retail store leases, certain customs requirements, and other contractual arrangements.InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company completed implementation of a new inventory costing system for approximately 95% of its inventories. In connection with the implementation, the Company changed its method of inventory costing from a moving average cost method to a first-in-first-out method. The Company believes this change in accounting principle is preferable because it results in more precision and consistency in global and regional inventory costs, more efficient analysis and better matching of inventory costs with revenues, better matches the physical flow of inventories, and improves comparability with industry peers. The change from the Company’s former inventory cost method did not have a material effect on inventory or cost of sales, and, as a result, prior comparative financial statements have not been restated.As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our finished goods inventories accounted for 99.3% and 97.5%, respectively, of our consolidated inventories, and the remaining balance consisted of raw materials and work-in-process.Marketing ExpensesTotal marketing expenses inclusive of advertising, production, promotion, and agency expenses were $14.5 million and $9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $55.4 million and $49.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Marketing expenses are reported in ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.Prepaid advertising and promotional endorsement expenses of $9.3 million and $7.0 million are included in ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.2. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  New Accounting Pronouncement AdoptedIncome Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs ActIn March 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued authoritative guidance on the income tax accounting implications of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act (“Tax Act”), addressing the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. The guidance provides a measurement period for companies to evaluate the impacts of the Tax Act on their financial statements. This measurement period begins in the reporting period that includes the enactment date and ends when an entity has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information that was needed in order to complete the accounting requirements, and cannot exceed one year. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017, including provisional estimates for the Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax (“BEAT”), Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”), and transition tax. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), and other standard-setting bodies may issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As we collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts that could materially affect our financial position and results of operations as well as our effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. See Note 10 — Income Taxes for more information.Stock Compensation Scope of Modification AccountingIn May 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to clarify those changes to terms and conditions of stock-based compensation awards that are required to be accounted for as modifications of existing stock-based awards. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2018. The adoption did not have an impact on our condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations. 6Table of ContentsClarifying the Definition of a BusinessIn January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to clarify the definition of a business, for purposes of determining whether a business has been acquired or sold, and consequently whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of a business or as acquisitions or disposals of assets. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2018. The adoption did not have an impact on our condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations. Statements of Cash Flows - Classification and Change in Restricted CashIn August 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statements of cash flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance requiring that restricted cash be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period amounts reported in the statements of cash flows. The guidance is applied retrospectively to all periods presented and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2018. As a result of the adoption, the Company changed the presentation in its statements of cash flows for all periods presented.Prepaid Stored-Value ProductsIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to the recognition of breakage for certain prepaid stored-value products. The standard is effective for annual periods (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Revenue RecognitionIn May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to revenue recognition from contracts with customers. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the guidance using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements was not restated and is reported under the accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. The adoption of this guidance did not have, and is not expected to have, a significant impact on our reported revenues, gross margins or income from operations.Substantially all of the Company’s revenues are recognized when control of product passes to customers when the products are shipped or delivered. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company changed its balance sheet presentation for expected product returns by reporting a product return asset for the right to receive returned products and a returns liability for amounts expected to be refunded to customers as a result of product returns. The product return asset is reported within ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The returns liability and payments received from customers for future delivery of products are reported within ‘Accrued liabilities and other expenses’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.The Company elected to account for shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control of product passes to customers as fulfillment costs, which are expensed as incurred and included in ‘Cost of sales’ in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. There is no change to the Company’s comparative reporting of shipping and handling costs as a result of adoption. The Company elected to expense incremental costs to obtain customer contracts, consisting primarily of commission incentives, when incurred and reports these costs within ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in its condensed consolidated statements of operations. There is no change to the Company’s comparative reporting of incremental costs to obtain customer contracts as a result of adoption.7Table of ContentsThe impact of adoption on the January 1, 2018 condensed consolidated balance sheet was:  December 31, 2017 Impact of Adoption (1) January 1, 2018  (in thousands)Assets:      Accounts receivable, net  $83,518 $1,801 $85,319  Prepaid expenses and other assets 22,596 1,555 24,151       Liabilities:      Accrued expenses and other liabilities 84,446 3,356 87,802(1)  Prior to adoption, product return assets and return liabilities were reported within ‘Accounts receivable, net’, within the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of the adoption date, the product return assets were reclassified and reported as a component of ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’, and return liabilities were reclassified to ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet.The impact of the new revenue recognition guidance on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2018 was:  September 30, 2018  Balances Without Adoption Effects of New Guidance (1) As Reported  (in thousands)Assets:      Accounts receivable, net  $106,091 $4,387 $110,478Prepaid expenses and other assets 22,982 2,874 25,856       Liabilities:      Accrued expenses and other liabilities 92,532 7,261 99,793(1)  The new revenue recognition guidance requires comparative disclosures of the effects of the new guidance on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements for all interim periods during the year of adoption. The new guidance did not have a significant effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018.See Note 8 — Revenues for additional disclosures.New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedReclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeIn February 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that permits reclassification of the income tax effects of the Tax Act on accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to retained earnings. This guidance may be adopted retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the income tax effects of the Tax Act related to items remaining in AOCI are recognized, or at the beginning of the period of adoption. The guidance becomes effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, measured on a discounted basis, at the commencement date for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. Additionally, this guidance will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases, including qualitative and quantitative requirements. The guidance will be applied under a modified retrospective 8Table of Contentstransition approach. The guidance and related amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted.In July 2017, the Company established an implementation team and engaged external advisers and solution providers to develop a multi-phase plan to assess the Company’s leasing arrangements, as well as any changes to accounting policies, processes, or necessary systems. The Company has procured the necessary software and services to facilitate adoption of the guidance. The Company is continuing its detailed review of its leases and other contractual arrangements, assessments of its systems and related accounting procedures and controls requirements. The Company has begun implementation of the software selected. The Company has elected all of the available transition practical expedients, including the ‘package of practical expedients’, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs, has elected not to apply ‘hindsight’ when adopting the standard, and has elected the short-term lease exemption. Further, the Company has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of its leases. Substantially all of the Company’s leases are operating leases under the new standard. The Company will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2019, which will also be the effective date for implementation of the standard. Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019. We expect that this standard will have a material effect on our financial statements. While we continue to assess all of the effects of the new standard, upon adoption we expect adoption to result in recognition of significant new lease-related assets and lease liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, and significant new disclosures in the footnotes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect that adoption of the standard will have a significant effect on the consolidated operating income or the cash flows of the Company.Other PronouncementsOther new pronouncements issued but not effective until after September 30, 2018 are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.3.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  Recurring Fair Value Measurements All of the Company’s derivative instruments are classified as Level 2 and are reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets within either ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’ or ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments were an asset of $0.6 million and a liability of $0.4 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. See Note 5 — Derivative Financial Instruments for more information.9Table of ContentsThe carrying amounts of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and current accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate their fair value as recorded due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.The Company’s borrowing instruments are recorded at their carrying values in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, which may differ from their respective fair values. The fair values of the Company’s outstanding notes payable approximate their carrying values at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, based on interest rates currently available to the Company for similar borrowings. September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value (in thousands)Borrowings and capital lease obligations$26 $26 $706 $706Non-Financial Assets and LiabilitiesThe Company’s non-financial assets, which primarily consist of property and equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets, are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying value. The fair values of these assets are determined based on Level 3 measurements, including estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows based upon historical experience, expected market conditions, and management’s plans. Impairment expense is reported in ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company recorded non-cash impairment expenses of $0.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively, to reduce the carrying values of certain retail store assets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company recorded non-cash impairment expenses of $0.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, to reduce the carrying values of certain supply chain assets related to the closure of our Mexico and Italy manufacturing and distribution facilities, included in ‘Other businesses,’ to their estimated fair values. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company recorded non-cash impairment expenses of $0.2 million to reduce the carrying values of certain retail store assets.5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  The Company transacts business in various foreign countries and is therefore exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk that impacts the reported U.S. Dollar amounts of revenues, expenses, and certain foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. In order to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency and to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company enters into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currency. By policy, the Company does not enter into these contracts for trading purposes or speculation. Counterparty default risk is considered low because the forward contracts that the Company enters into are over-the-counter instruments transacted with highly-rated financial institutions. The Company was not required to and did not post collateral as of September 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017.The Company’s derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company reports derivative instruments with the same counterparty on a net basis when a master netting arrangement is in place. Changes in fair value are recognized within ‘Foreign currency gains (losses), net’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company classifies cash flows from derivative instruments at settlement in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items within ‘Cash provided by operating activities.’10Table of ContentsResults of Derivative ActivitiesThe fair values of derivative assets and liabilities, net, all of which are classified as Level 2 and are reported within either ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’ or ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, were: September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Derivative Assets Derivative Liabilities Derivative Assets Derivative Liabilities (in thousands)Forward foreign currency exchange contracts$1,581 $(987) $1,241 $(1,647)Netting of counterparty contracts(987) 987 (1,241) 1,241  Foreign currency forward contract derivatives$594 $— $— $(406)The notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts presented below report the total U.S. Dollar equivalent position and the net contract fair values for each foreign currency position. September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Notional Fair Value Notional Fair Value (in thousands)Singapore Dollar$36,985 $(102) $73,455 $364Euro48,865 (90) 37,718 (122)Japanese Yen40,510 171 30,688 (89)South Korean Won30,974 (29) 15,888 (134)British Pound Sterling50,406 12 13,233 80Other currencies62,452 632 53,698 (505)Total$270,192 $594 $224,680 $(406)        Latest maturity dateOctober 2018 January 2018Amounts reported in ‘Foreign currency gains (losses), net’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations include both realized and unrealized gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions and derivative contracts, and were: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in thousands)Foreign currency transaction gains (losses)$(1,382) $(674) $(894) $1,120Foreign currency forward exchange contracts gains (losses)1,615 417 2,481 (939)Foreign currency gains (losses), net$233 $(257) $1,587 $1816.

The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict certain actions by the Company, including limitations on: (i) stock repurchases to an aggregate of $100.0 million per fiscal year, subject to certain restrictions; and (ii) capital expenditures and commitments to $50.0 million per year. The Credit Agreement also permits intercompany loans of up to $375.0 million and requires the Company to meet certain financial covenant ratios that become effective when average outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, including letters of credit, exceed the lesser of $40.0 million or 40% of the total commitments during certain periods or if the outstanding borrowings exceed the borrowing base. If the financial covenant ratios are in effect, the Company must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.As of September 30, 2018, the total commitments available from the lenders under the Facility were $100.0 million. At September 30, 2018, the Company had no outstanding borrowings and $0.6 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Facility, which reduces amounts available for borrowing under the Facility. As of both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had $99.4 million, respectively, of available borrowing capacity under the Facility. The Facility matures in February 2021.On November 5, 2018, the Company entered into the Sixteenth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which, among other things: (i) increased the total commitments under the Credit Agreement to $150.0 million from $100.0 million; (ii) increased permitted stock repurchases to $200.0 million from $100.0 million per year; (iii) increased total permitted stock repurchases to $800.0 million from $600.0 million cumulatively; and (iv) added an additional lender under the Credit Agreement.Asia Revolving Credit Facilities The Company’s revolving credit facility agreement with HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch (“HSBC”), or the “HSBC Facility,” provides the Company uncommitted dual currency revolving loan facilities of up to 40.0 million Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”), or $5.8 million, with a combined facility limit of RMB 60.0 million, or $8.7 million. The HSBC Facility may be canceled at any time by either party. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding and borrowings under the HSBC Facility remained suspended at the discretion of HSBC.The Company’s one year revolving credit facility agreement with China Merchants Bank Company Limited, Shanghai Branch (the “CMBC Facility”), provides the Company a revolving loan facility of up to 30.0 million RMB, or $4.4 million, subject to consent by the lender. The CMBC Facility matures in January 2019. The CMBC Facility may be canceled or suspended at any time by either party. As of September 30, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding on this credit facility.MaturitiesThe maturities of the Company’s capital lease obligations were: As ofSeptember 30, 2018 (in thousands)2018 (remainder of year)$2201992020920216Total capital lease obligations26Less: current portion11Non-current portion$1512Table of Contents7. COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 0.6 million and 2.4 million shares of its common stock, respectively, at a cost of $11.1 million and $37.0 million, including commissions, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company repurchased 2.1 million and 3.4 million shares of its common stock, respectively, for $17.1 million and $27.1 million, including commissions, respectively. As of September 30, 2018, the Company had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately $181.8 million of its common stock, subject to restrictions under its Credit Agreement. 8. REVENUES The Company adopted authoritative guidance related to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements was not restated and is reported under the accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. See ‘Revenue Recognition’ in Note 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements for a discussion of the significant changes resulting from adoption of the guidance. The adoption of the guidance did not have a significant impact on revenues.Revenues by reportable operating segment and by channel were:  Three Months Ended September 30, 2018  Americas Asia Pacific Europe Other Businesses Total  (in thousands)Wholesale (1) $44,883 $40,938 $29,373 $1,525 $116,719Retail 65,247 22,942 10,345 — 98,534E-commerce 26,827 11,283 7,701 — 45,811Total revenues $136,957 $75,163 $47,419 $1,525 $261,064  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018  Americas Asia Pacific Europe Other Businesses Total  (in thousands)Wholesale (1) $171,477 $172,152 $130,150 $2,133 $475,912Retail 156,557 71,359 29,601 — 257,517E-commerce 70,515 45,134 23,138 — 138,787Total revenues $398,549 $288,645 $182,889 $2,133 $872,216(1) In the third quarter of 2018, certain revenues previously reported within the ‘Asia Pacific’ segment were shifted to the ‘Europe’ segment.Revenues are recognized in the amount expected to be received in exchange for goods when control of the products transfers to customers, and excludes various forms of promotions, which range from contractually-fixed percentage price reductions to sales returns, discounts, rebates, and other incentives that may vary in amount and must be estimated. Variable amounts are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and adjusted as better estimates become available. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company recognized increases of $0.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, to wholesale revenues due to changes in estimates related to products transferred to customers in prior periods. There were no changes to estimates in retail and e-commerce channels during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018.The Company elected to exclude from revenues taxes assessed by governmental authorities, including value-added and other sales-related taxes, that are imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing activities, and, as a result, there is no change in presentation from prior comparative periods.The following is a description of our principal revenue-generating activities by distribution channel. The Company has three reportable operating segments and sells its products using three primary distribution channels. For more detailed information about reportable operating segments, see ‘Note 13 — Operating Segments and Geographic Information’. 13Table of ContentsWholesale ChannelFor the majority of wholesale customers, control transfers and revenues are recognized when the product is shipped or delivered from a manufacturing facility or distribution center to the wholesale customer. In certain cases, control of the product transfers and revenues are recognized when the customer receives the product at the designated delivery point. For certain customers, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, cash payment from customers is required in advance of delivery and revenues are recognized upon the later of cash receipt or delivery of the product. For a small number of customers in the Asia Pacific region, products are sold on consignment and revenues are recognized on a sell-through basis. Wholesale customers are invoiced when products are shipped or delivered.The Company has arrangements that grant certain wholesale customers exclusive licenses, concurrent with the terms of the related distribution agreements, to use the Company’s intellectual property in exchange for a sales-based royalty. Sales-based royalty revenues are recognized over the terms of the related license agreements as sales are made by the wholesalers.Retail ChannelThe Company transfers control of products and recognizes revenues at retail stores at the point of sale, in exchange for cash or other payment, primarily debit or credit card. A portion of the transaction price charged to our customers is variable, primarily due to promotional discounts or allowances, and terms that permit retail customers to exchange or return products for a full refund within a limited period of time. When recognizing revenues, the amount of revenues associated with expected sales returns is estimated based on historical experience, and adjustments to our estimates are made when the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive changes. E-commerce ChannelIn the e-commerce channel, the Company transfers control and recognizes revenues when the product is shipped from the distribution centers. Payment from customers is primarily through debit and credit card and is made at the time the customer order is shipped.Similar to the retail channel, a portion of the amount of revenue is variable, primarily due to sales returns, discounts, and other promotional allowances offered to our customers. When recognizing revenues, the amount of revenues associated with expected sales returns is estimated based on historical experience, and adjustments are made when the most likely amount of consideration changes. Historically, the amount of revenues associated with product returns in the e-commerce channel has been higher than the retail channel.Contract LiabilitiesContract liabilities consist of advance cash deposits received from wholesale customers to secure product orders in connection with seasonal selling seasons, and payments received in advance of delivery. As products are shipped and control transfers, the Company recognizes the deferred revenue in ‘Revenues’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. At January 1 and September 30, 2018, $1.3 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of deferred revenues associated with advance customer deposits were reported in ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenues of $0.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively, were recognized in revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018. The remainder of deferred revenues at September 30, 2018 are expected to be recognized in revenues during the fourth quarter of 2018 as products are shipped or delivered.Refund LiabilitiesRefund liabilities, primarily associated with product sales returns, retrospective volume rebates, and early payment discounts are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience, and adjustments to revenues made when the most likely amount of consideration expected changes. At January 1 and September 30, 2018, $3.4 million and $7.3 million, respectively, of refund liabilities, primarily associated with product returns, were reported in ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 9. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The Company’s share-based compensation awards are issued under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (“2015 Plan”) and two predecessor plans, the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, and the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2007 Plan”). Any awards that expire or are forfeited under the 2007 Plan become available for issuance under the 2015 Plan. As of September 30, 2018, 2.4 million 14Table of Contentsshares of common stock remained available for future issuance under the 2015 Plan, subject to adjustment for future stock splits, stock dividends, and similar changes in capitalization.Refer to Notes 1 and 10 of the Company’s Annual Report for a detailed description of the Company’s share-based compensation awards, including information related to grant date fair value, vesting terms, performance, and other conditions.Share-Based Compensation ExpensePre-tax share-based compensation expense reported in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations was: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in thousands)Cost of sales$91 $93 $268 $293Selling, general and administrative expenses3,214 2,813 9,052 6,558Total share-based compensation expense$3,305 $2,906 $9,320 $6,851Stock Option ActivityStock option activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was: Number of Options (in thousands)Outstanding December 31, 2017541Granted—Exercised(123)Forfeited or expired(27)Outstanding September 30, 2018391As of September 30, 2018, the Company had $0.3 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested options, which is expected to be amortized over the remaining weighted average period of 1.65 years.Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units ActivityThe Company grants time-based restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) as well as time-based and performance-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”).

As of September 30, 2018, unrecognized share-based compensation expenses for time-based and 15Table of Contentsperformance-based awards were $9.1 million and $7.6 million, respectively, and are expected to amortize over remaining weighted average period of 1.52 years and 2.43 years, respectively.10. INCOME TAXES Income tax expense and effective tax rates were: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in thousands, except effective tax rate)Income before income taxes$14,584 $2,584 $79,173 $48,118Income tax expense4,092 955 17,850 13,519Effective tax rate28.1% 37.0% 22.5% 28.1%During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the decrease in the effective tax rate, compared to the same period in 2017, is due to the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, partially offset by operating losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits, tax expense recorded in profitable jurisdictions, and the impact of the GILTI provisions included in the Tax Act. The Company evaluates the need for valuation allowances by analyzing all available positive and negative evidence. The Company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits in certain jurisdictions and the valuation allowances in these jurisdictions have been released. In other jurisdictions, the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits and has maintained or recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions. The Company has elected to account for GILTI as a period cost, and therefore has included GILTI expense in the effective tax rate calculation. The Company’s effective income tax rate, for each period presented, also differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate due to the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions and differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $4.6 million and $6.2 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and the Company does not expect any significant changes in tax benefits in the next twelve months.The Company’s tax rate fluctuates and may increase or decrease with changes in, among other things, the amount of income or loss by jurisdiction, the Company’s ability to utilize net operating losses and foreign tax credits, changes in tax laws, and the movement of liabilities established pursuant to accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions as statutes of limitations expire, positions are effectively settled, or when additional information becomes available. There are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions and other changes to regulatory environments in countries in which we do business that, if enacted, may have an impact on the Company’s effective tax rate.Additionally, the Company continues to evaluate the impacts of the Tax Act. As the Company further understands its implications, as well as the related, and yet to be issued, regulations and interpretations, the Company’s effective tax rate could be impacted. The Company is still evaluating the GILTI provisions of the Tax Act and the related implications and has concluded that the Company will record as a periodic expense as incurred, and, therefore, has not recorded deferred taxes for GILTI. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, the Company made adjustments to the amounts recorded as of December 31, 2017, as a result of the Tax Act related to U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. As of December 31, 2017, the Company recorded provisional amounts based on estimates of the effects of the Tax Act as the analysis requires significant data from its foreign subsidiaries that is not regularly collected or analyzed. The U.S. federal transition tax liability, net of newly generated income tax credits, was an obligation of $17.1 million. Upon gathering additional information, the Company determined this liability to be $19.5 million. The Company has existing foreign tax credits and other attributes which fully offset this transition tax obligation. However, the Company continues to consider these amounts provisional for the reasons discussed above. Additional impacts from the Tax Act will be recorded as they are identified during the measurement period pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"). The Company’s determination of the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed no later than one year from the enactment date as permitted under SAB 118. Any further adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period will be finalized as part of our fourth quarter income tax procedures and recorded as part of the December 31, 2018 provision.16Table of Contents11. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic and diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in thousands, except per share data)Numerator:       Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders$6,520 $(2,263) $49,469 $22,978Less: Net income allocable to Series A Preferred stockholders (1)(1,114) — (8,319) (3,642)Remaining net income (loss) available to common stockholders - basic and diluted$5,406 $(2,263) $41,150 $19,336Denominator:       Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic67,821 71,895 68,223 73,212Plus: dilutive effect of stock options and unvested restricted stock units4,953 — 2,881 948Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted72,774 71,895 71,104 74,160        Net income (loss) per common share:       Basic$0.08 $(0.03) $0.60 $0.26Diluted$0.07 $(0.03) $0.58 $0.26(1) Represents the amount which would have been paid to preferred stockholders in the event the Company had declared a dividend on its common stock.An insignificant number of options and RSUs were antidilutive for the three month period ended September 30, 2018. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, 0.1 million and 0.7 million options and RSUs, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS under the two-class method because the effect was anti-dilutive. If converted, the Series A Preferred Stock would represent approximately 17.0% of the Company’s common stock outstanding, or 13.8 million additional common shares, as of September 30, 2018.12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  Rental Commitments and ContingenciesThe Company rents retail store, office and warehouse space, vehicles, and equipment under operating leases expiring at various dates through 2033. Rent expense for leases with escalations or rent holidays is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term beginning on the lease inception date. Certain leases also provide for contingent rents, which are generally determined as a percent of sales in excess of specified levels. A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable. 17Table of ContentsFuture minimum lease payments under operating leases were: As ofSeptember 30, 2018 (in thousands)2018 (remainder of year)$12,215201938,847202031,305202125,130202217,203Thereafter50,039     Total minimum lease payments$174,739Minimum sublease rental income of $0.1 million under non-cancelable subleases, and contingent rentals are excluded from the commitment schedule.

During its normal course of business, the Company may make certain indemnities, commitments, and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments. The Company cannot determine a range of estimated future payments and has not recorded any liability for indemnities, commitments, and guarantees in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.See Note 14 — Legal Proceedings for further details regarding potential loss contingencies related to government tax audits and other current legal proceedings.18Table of Contents13. OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION The Company has three reportable operating segments based on the geographic nature of its operations: Americas, Asia Pacific, and Europe. In addition, the ‘Other businesses’ category aggregates insignificant operating segments that do not meet the reportable segment threshold, including company-operated manufacturing operations and corporate operations.Each of the reportable operating segments derives its revenues from the sale of footwear and accessories to external customers. Revenues for ‘Other businesses’ include non-footwear product sales to external customers that are excluded from the measurement of segment operating revenues and income. Segment performance is evaluated based on segment results without allocating corporate expenses, or indirect general, administrative, and other expenses. Segment profits or losses include adjustments to eliminate inter-segment sales. Reconciling items between segment income from operations and income from operations consist of other businesses and unallocated corporate and other expenses, as well as inter-segment eliminations. The following tables set forth information related to reportable operating segments: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in thousands)Revenues:       Americas$136,957 $120,459 $398,549 $374,336Asia Pacific (1)75,163 75,320 288,645 278,656Europe (1)47,419 47,240 182,889 170,864Total segment revenues259,539 243,019 870,083 823,856Other businesses1,525 254 2,133 545Total consolidated revenues$261,064 $243,273 $872,216 $824,401Income from operations: (2)       Americas$42,586 $24,398 $110,814 $81,132Asia Pacific (1)16,861 14,115 74,640 70,880Europe (1)12,064 4,870 53,819 35,182Total segment income from operations71,511 43,383 239,273 187,194Reconciliation of total segment income from operations to income before income taxes:       Other businesses (3)(14,092) (6,233) (41,557) (16,883)Unallocated corporate and other (2)(43,524) (34,465) (120,835) (122,598)Income from operations13,895 2,685 76,881 47,713Foreign currency gains, net233 (257) 1,587 181Interest income422 269 847 576Interest expense(126) (167) (371) (539)Other income160 54 229 187Income before income taxes$14,584 $2,584 $79,173 $48,118Depreciation and amortization:       Americas$1,098 $1,383 $3,613 $4,075Asia Pacific422 863 1,655 2,710Europe301 374 980 1,138Total segment depreciation and amortization1,821 2,620 6,248 7,923Other businesses1,213 1,618 4,168 5,106Unallocated corporate and other3,627 3,648 11,119 11,672Total consolidated depreciation and amortization$6,661 $7,886 $21,535 $24,701(1) In the third quarter of 2018, certain revenues and expenses previously reported within the ‘Asia Pacific’ segment were shifted to the ‘Europe’ segment.The previously reported amounts for revenues and income from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 19Table of Contents2017 have also been revised to conform to the current period presentation.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company was subjected to an audit by the Brazilian Federal Tax Authorities related to imports of footwear from China between 2010 and 2014. On January 13, 2015, the Company was notified about the issuance of assessments totaling 14.4 million Brazilian Real (“BRL”), or approximately $3.6 million, plus interest and penalties, for the period January 2010 through May 2011. The Company has disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to the claims. On February 25, 2015, the Company received additional assessments totaling 33.3 million BRL, or approximately $8.2 million, plus interest and penalties, related to the remainder of the audit period. The Company has also disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to these claims in administrative appeals. On August 29, 2017, the Company received a favorable ruling on its appeal of the first assessment, which dismissed all fines, penalties, and interest. The tax authorities have requested a special appeal to that decision. If the appeal is accepted, Crocs will have the opportunity to both defend the appeal as well as challenge it procedurally. Should the Brazilian Tax Authority prevail in this final administrative appeal, Crocs may still challenge the assessments through the court system, which would likely require the posting of a bond. Additionally, the second appeal for the remaining assessments was heard on March 22, 2018. That decision was partially favorable and resulted in an approximately 38% reduction in principal, penalties, and interest, leaving approximately $5.1 million, plus interest and penalties, at risk for those assessments. The tax authorities have appealed that decision. Crocs intends to file a response to the tax authorities’ appeal as well as a separate appeal against the unfavorable portion of the ruling. We have not recorded these items within the condensed consolidated financial statements as it is not possible at this time to predict the timing or outcome of this matter or to estimate a potential amount of loss, if any.For all other claims and disputes, where the Company is able to estimate reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses, the Company estimates that as of September 30, 2018, reasonably possible losses associated with these claims and other disputes are immaterial.Although the Company is subject to other litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including employment, intellectual property and product liability claims, the Company is not party to any other pending legal proceedings that it believes would reasonably have a material adverse impact on its business, financial results, and cash flows.20Table of Contents21Table of ContentsITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business OverviewCrocs, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively the “Company,” “Crocs,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) are engaged in the design, development, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children. We strive to be the global leader in the sale of molded footwear characterized by functionality, comfort, color, and lightweight design. All of our products utilize our proprietary closed-cell resin, called CrosliteTM, along with a range of other materials, enabling us to produce innovative, lightweight footwear.Known or Anticipated TrendsBased on our recent operating results and current perspectives on our operating environment, we anticipate certain trends will impact our operating results:•Consumer spending preferences continue to shift toward e-commerce and away from brick and mortar stores. This has resulted in continued sales growth in our e-commerce channel, as well as on various e-tail sites operated by wholesalers.•As we close less productive stores as leases expire and transfer select company-operated stores to distributors, we are experiencing a reduction in retail revenues and a benefit to selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”). Distributor revenues are reported within our wholesale channel.•Foreign exchange rate volatility impacts our reported U.S. Dollar results from our foreign operations. •In 2017 we identified annual reductions in SG&A in the amount of $75 to $85 million which, once implemented, are projected to generate an annual $30 to $35 million improvement in earnings before interest and taxes by 2019, compared to 2016. We achieved approximately $23 million of these SG&A reductions in 2017 while incurring approximately $10 million of expenses related to variable compensation. We remain on track to achieve the targeted SG&A reductions by 2019. We incurred $11 million in non-recurring charges to achieve these SG&A reductions in 2017 and expect to incur approximately $6 million in additional non-recurring charges related to SG&A reductions in 2018. We reduced our company-operated retail stores by 111 in 2017 and we completed 62 store closures and transfers in the first nine months of 2018, which brought our total store count to 389 from 558 over a two year period. The majority of company-operated store closures are occurring as store leases expire. •We are prioritizing growth in our lower-priced, higher-margin molded footwear styles, primarily in clog and sandal silhouettes, as we drive global alignment of our product portfolio and focus on sustainable, profitable revenue growth. •In connection with ongoing efforts to simplify the business and improve profitability, we decided to fully outsource our production to third-party manufacturers and to close our manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Italy. The manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Italy and the distribution facility in Mexico were closed in the third quarter of 2018. We have incurred total charges of $13.0 million before taxes in the first nine months of 2018 related to the closures, approximately $6 million of which were non-cash. We do not expect to incur any significant additional expenses related to the Mexico and Italy closures through the remainder of 2018. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), we present certain information related to our current period results of operations through “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed as a supplement to our results of operations and presentation of reportable operating segments under U.S. GAAP. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using prior year average foreign exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management uses constant currency to assist in comparing business trends from period to period on a consistent basis in communications with the Board of Directors (the “Board”), stockholders, analysts, and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe constant currency is useful to investors and other users of our condensed consolidated financial statements as an additional tool to evaluate operating performance. We believe it also provides a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our operations. Investors should not consider constant currency in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.22Table of ContentsThird Quarter 2018 Financial HighlightsThe following were significant developments in our businesses during the three months ended September 30, 2018:•Revenues were $261.1 million, growing 7.3% over the third quarter of 2017, or 9.3% on a constant currency basis. Our wholesale revenues grew 9.3% and our e-commerce revenues grew 23.2%, which more than offset the 0.8% decline in our retail revenues resulting from the store closures discussed below.•We sold 13.3 million pairs of shoes worldwide, an increase of 2.0% from 13.1 million pairs in the three months ended September 30, 2017.•Gross margin was 53.3%, an increase of 250 basis points from last year’s third quarter.•SG&A was $125.2 million compared to $120.8 million in the third quarter of 2017. As a percent of revenues, SG&A improved 170 basis points to 47.9% of revenues. Third quarter 2018 results included $1.3 million of non-recurring charges associated with our SG&A reduction plan compared to $3.6 million in last year’s third quarter and $5.0 million of non-recurring charges associated with the closure of company-operated manufacturing and distribution facilities.•Income from operations of $13.9 million increased 417.5% compared to $2.7 million in last year’s third quarter. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $6.5 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $2.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in last year’s third quarter. We had 72.8 million and 71.9 million weighted average diluted common shares outstanding on September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. •We continued to focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations, including carefully managing and reducing our retail store fleet, especially full-priced retail stores. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we opened three and closed 12 company-operated retail stores, to end the quarter with 389 stores.•We repurchased 0.6 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $11.1 million. Future Outlook We intend to continue advancing our strategic objectives, focusing on three key initiatives to: (1) drive sustainable, profitable revenue growth;(2) improve the quality of revenues to enhance gross margins, and;(3) simplify our business to reduce costs. We are focusing on our core molded footwear heritage by narrowing our product line to emphasize higher-margin units, as well as developing innovative new casual lifestyle footwear platforms. By streamlining our product portfolio to focus on the most successful designs, driving global alignment of our product offerings, and investing in marketing, we believe we are creating a more powerful consumer connection to the brand. We are refining our business model around the world, prioritizing direct investment in larger-scale geographies to focus our resources on the demographics with the largest growth prospects, and transferring significant commercial responsibilities to distributors. Further, we are expanding our engagement with leading wholesale accounts in select markets to drive sales growth, optimize product placement, and enhance brand reputation.We are on track to complete our SG&A reduction plan this year, which will enable us to reduce our annualized SG&A budget by $75 to $85 million compared to 2016. As of September 30, 2018, we have exceeded our 160 company-operated retail store closure target and reduced our store count by 169 stores since the end of 2016. 23Table of ContentsResults of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, % Change 2018 2017 2018 2017 Q3 2018-2017 YTD 2018-2017 (in thousands, except per share, margin, and average selling price data)Revenues$261,064 $243,273 $872,216 $824,401 7.3 % 5.8 %Cost of sales122,005 119,810 411,884 397,547 (1.8)% (3.6)%Gross profit139,059 123,463 460,332 426,854 12.6 % 7.8 %Selling, general and administrative expenses125,164 120,778 383,451 379,141 (3.6)% (1.1)%Income from operations13,895 2,685 76,881 47,713 417.5 % 61.1 %Foreign currency gains (losses), net233 (257) 1,587 181 190.7 % 776.8 %Interest income422 269 847 576 56.9 % 47.0 %Interest expense(126) (167) (371) (539) 24.6 % 31.2 %Other income160 54 229 187 196.3 % 22.5 %Income before income taxes14,584 2,584 79,173 48,118 464.4 % 64.5 %Income tax expense 4,092 955 17,850 13,519 (328.5)% (32.0)%Net income 10,492 1,629 61,323 34,599 544.1 % 77.2 %Dividends on Series A convertible preferred stock(3,000) (3,000) (9,000) (9,000) — % — %Dividend equivalents on Series A convertible preferred shares related to redemption value accretion and beneficial conversion feature(972) (892) (2,854) (2,621) (9.0)% (8.9)%Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders$6,520 $(2,263) $49,469 $22,978 388.1 % 115.3 %Net income (loss) per common share:          Basic$0.08 $(0.03) $0.60 $0.26 366.7 % 130.8 %Diluted$0.07 $(0.03) $0.58 $0.26 333.3 % 123.1 %            Gross margin (1)53.3% 50.8% 52.8% 51.8% 250bp 100bpOperating margin (1)5.3% 1.1% 8.8% 5.8% 420bp 300bpFootwear unit sales13,309 13,050 48,188 46,868 2.0 % 2.8 %Average footwear selling price - nominal basis$18.90 $18.17 $17.66 $17.26 4.0 % 2.3 %Average footwear selling price - constant currency basis (2)$19.25 $18.17 $17.71 $17.26 5.9 % 2.6 %(1)  Changes for gross margin and operating margin are shown in basis points (“bp”).(2)  Reflects year over year change as if the current period results were in constant currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Revenues increased $17.8 million, or 7.3%, during the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Growth in our wholesale and e-commerce channels more than offset a decline in our retail channel resulting from our targeted reduction in the number of company-operated retail stores. Our wholesale channel grew by 9.3%, with especially strong performance in Asia Pacific and the Americas during the third quarter. Our e-commerce channel grew by 23.2% due to increased traffic, higher units per transaction, and a higher average selling price (“ASP”) as consumers continued to migrate to online shopping channels, and the Company continued to invest in digital marketing. Our retail channel decreased by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017, as we operated 85 fewer retail stores compared to September 30, 2017. Higher ASP increased revenues by approximately $17.7 million, or 7.2%. Higher unit sales volume increased revenues by $4.8 million, or 2.0%. A decrease of $4.7 million, or 1.9%, resulted from unfavorable foreign currency translation.24Table of ContentsRevenues increased $47.8 million, or 5.8%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in revenues was led by 23.7% growth in our e-commerce channel and 7.4% growth in our wholesale channel. These increases more than offset a reduction in our retail channel of 4.3%, resulting from our targeted reduction in the number of company-operated retail stores, partially offset by increased units per transactions in our remaining company-operated retail stores. Higher unit sales volume resulted in an increase in revenues of approximately $23.2 million, or 2.8%, and an increase of $7.7 million, or 1.0%, was attributable to a higher ASP as our product, store, and channel mix continued to change due to store closures and business model changes as we implement our strategic plan. An increase of $16.9 million, or 2.0%, resulted from favorable foreign currency translation.Future changes in ASP will be impacted by: (i) the mix of products sold, (ii) the sales channel under which sales are made (as we generally realize higher sales prices from our retail and e-commerce channels compared to our wholesale channel), (iii) the level of sales discounts and incentives we offer our customers, and (iv) the impact of foreign currency translation.Cost of sales. Cost of sales increased $2.2 million, or 1.8%, during the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Higher unit sales volume resulted in an increase in cost of sales of $2.4 million, or 2.0%, and foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease of $2.2 million, or 1.8%. Changes in product mix contributed to a higher average cost per unit, accounting for a $2.0 million, or 1.6%, increase in cost of sales. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, cost of sales increased $14.3 million, or 3.6%, compared to the same period in 2017. Higher unit sales volume resulted in an increase of $11.2 million, or 2.8%, in cost of sales, partially offset by a decrease of $4.8 million, or 1.2%, due to a lower average cost per unit. Lower average cost per unit were primarily the result of product mix, reflecting our ongoing focus on core molded products, which cost less to produce, and continued supply chain cost reductions. The effect of foreign currency translation was an increase of $7.9 million, or 2.0%, in cost of sales. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $15.6 million, or 12.6%, during the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Gross margin improved 250 basis points to 53.3% compared to the same period in 2017, driven by favorable product mix. An increase of $15.7 million, or 12.7%, resulted from increases in ASP. An increase of approximately $2.4 million, or 1.9%, resulted from higher unit sales volume and a decrease of $2.5 million, or 2.0%, resulted from foreign currency translation. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, gross profit increased $33.5 million, or 7.8%, and gross margin increased 100 basis points to 52.8% compared to the same period in 2017, driven by favorable product mix and the favorable impact of currency on inventory costs in our overseas markets. Higher unit sales volume drove an increase of approximately $12.1 million, or 2.8%, an increase of $12.5 million, or 2.9%, resulted from a higher ASP, and an increase of $8.9 million, or 2.1%, resulted from foreign currency translation. Selling, general and administrative expenses. SG&A increased $4.4 million, or 3.6%, during the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher variable compensation of $7.0 million associated with higher revenues, increased marketing expense of $4.6 million, and non-recurring expenses of $6.3 million compared to $3.6 million for the same period in 2017, partially offset by lower professional service fees of $3.4 million, facilities expense of $2.2 million, and other net expenses of $4.3 million, none of which were individually significant. As a percent of sales, SG&A improved by 170 basis points to 47.9%, a reflection of our SG&A reduction efforts. SG&A increased $4.3 million, or 1.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. As a percent of sales, SG&A improved by 200 basis points to 44.0%. The increase was primarily due to non-recurring expenses of $17.2 million compared to $7.6 million for the same period in 2017, higher variable compensation of $6.7 million associated with higher revenues, and higher marketing expense of $5.8 million, partially offset by decreases of $8.3 million in professional service fees, $6.5 million in facilities expense as a result of fewer company-owned retail stores, and other net expenses of $3.0 million.Foreign currency gains (losses), net. Foreign currency gains (losses), net, consists of realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses from the remeasurement and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivative instruments. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recognized realized and unrealized net foreign currency gains of $0.2 million compared to losses of $0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2017. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we recognized realized and unrealized foreign currency net gains of $1.6 million, compared to $0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Income tax expense. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, income tax expense increased $3.1 million compared to the same period in 2017. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was 28.1% compared to an effective tax rate of 37.0% for the same period in 2017, an 8.9% decrease. The decrease in the effective rate was due to the release 25Table of Contentsof valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, partially offset by operating losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits, tax expense recorded in profitable jurisdictions, and the impact of the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions included in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act (“Tax Act”). The Company evaluates the need for valuation allowances by analyzing all available positive and negative evidence. The Company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits in certain jurisdictions and the valuation allowances in these jurisdictions have been released. In other jurisdictions, the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits and has maintained or recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions. The Company has elected to account for GILTI as a period cost, and therefore has included GILTI expense in the effective tax rate calculation. Our effective tax rate of 28.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate due to the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions and differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, income tax expense increased $4.3 million compared to the same period in 2017. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was 22.5% compared to an effective tax rate of 28.1% for the same period in 2017, a 5.6% decrease. This decrease in the effective rate was due to the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, partially offset by operating losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits, tax expense recorded in profitable jurisdictions, and the impact of the GILTI provisions included in the Tax Act. The Company evaluates the need for valuation allowances by analyzing all available positive and negative evidence. The Company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits in certain jurisdictions and the valuation allowances in these jurisdictions have been released. In other jurisdictions, the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits and has maintained or recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions.The Company has elected to account for GILTI as a period cost, and therefore has included GILTI expense in the effective tax rate calculation. Our effective tax rate of 22.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate due to differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions as well as book losses in certain jurisdictions for which tax benefits cannot be recognized.The Company’s tax rate fluctuates and may increase or decrease with changes in, among other things, the amount of income or loss by jurisdiction, the Company’s ability to utilize net operating losses and foreign tax credits, changes in tax laws, and the movement of liabilities established pursuant to accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions as statutes of limitations expire, positions are effectively settled, or when additional information becomes available. There are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions and other changes to regulatory environments in countries in which we do business that, if enacted, may have an impact on the Company’s effective tax rate.Additionally, the Company continues to evaluate the impacts of the Tax Act. As the Company further understands its implications, as well as the related, and yet to be issued, regulations and interpretations, the Company’s effective tax rate could be impacted. The Company is still evaluating the GILTI provisions of the Tax Act and the related implications and has concluded that the Company will record as a periodic expense as incurred, and, therefore has not recorded deferred taxes for GILTI. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, the Company made adjustments to the amounts recorded as of December 31, 2017, as a result of the Tax Act related to U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. As of December 31, 2017, the Company recorded provisional amounts based on estimates of the effects of the Tax Act as the analysis requires significant data from its foreign subsidiaries that is not regularly collected or analyzed. The U.S. federal transition tax liability, net of newly generated income tax credits, was an obligation of $17.1 million. Upon gathering additional information, the Company determined this liability to be $19.5 million. The Company has existing foreign tax credits and other attributes which fully offset this transition tax obligation. However, the Company continues to consider these amounts provisional for the reasons discussed above.

See ‘Impacts on revenue of segment composition change’ table below for more information.Impacts on revenue of segment composition change:  Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017  Increase (Decrease)  (in thousands)Wholesale:    Asia Pacific $(4,719) $(21,545)Europe 4,719 21,545Retail:    Asia Pacific — (2,827)Europe — 2,827Wholesale channel revenues. Revenues from our wholesale channel increased $10.0 million, or 9.3%, during the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. An increase of $7.0 million, or 6.5%, was driven by a higher ASP. An increase of approximately $6.8 million, or 6.4%, resulted from higher unit sales volume due to increased customer demand with distributors and e-tail customers as consumers shift towards online purchasing. Foreign currency translation drove a decrease of $3.8 million, or 3.6%.During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, revenues from our wholesale channel increased $32.9 million, or 7.4%, compared to the same period in 2017. Higher unit sales volume of approximately $22.7 million, or 5.1%, were partially offset by a lower ASP of $1.0 million, or 0.2%, while the effect of foreign currency translation was an increase $11.2 million, or 2.5%.  Retail channel revenues. Revenues from our retail channel decreased $0.8 million, or 0.8%, during the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease in retail channel revenues was due to targeted reductions in our company-operated retail store fleet, consistent with our store rationalization plan. As of September 30, 2018, we operated 27Table of Contents85 fewer stores compared to the end of last year’s third quarter. Our comparable retail store sales grew 15.0% on a global basis, attributable to higher ASP and units per transaction. A decrease of $6.9 million, or 7.0%, was due to lower unit sales volume related to store count reduction, partially offset by a favorable impact of $6.7 million, or 6.8%, due to ASP related to product mix and improved quality of revenues. The effect of foreign currency translation was a decrease of $0.6 million, or 0.6%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, revenues from our retail channel decreased $11.7 million, or 4.3%, compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease in retail channel revenues was due primarily to net reduction of 85 company-operated retail stores, consistent with our store rationalization plan, partially offset by ASP gains and favorable foreign currency impacts. Unit sales volume decreased by approximately $24.0 million, or 8.9%. Favorable product mix and improved quality of revenues, the results of less promotional discounting and improved inventory composition, resulted in a higher ASP impact of $9.7 million, or 3.6%. An increase of $2.6 million, or 1.0%, resulted from foreign currency translation.   E-commerce channel revenues. Revenues from our e-commerce channel, which includes our own e-commerce sites as well as sales through third-party marketplaces, increased $8.6 million, or 23.2%, during the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, as this channel continued to grow in each region. Improved in-stock levels and investment in digital marketing resulted in increased e-commerce traffic. Changes in product mix resulted in an increase of $6.0 million, or 16.2%, from higher ASP. Revenues increased by $2.9 million, or 7.9%, from higher unit sales volume as a result of increased consumer demand and a continuing shift toward online purchasing. Foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease of $0.3 million, or 0.9%.During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, revenues from our e-commerce channel increased $26.6 million, or 23.7%, compared to the same period in 2017. Revenues increased by $17.0 million, or 15.1%, from higher unit sales volume, and higher ASP related to mix contributed an additional $6.6 million, or 5.9%. Favorable foreign currency translation resulted in an increase of $3.0 million, or 2.7%.28Table of ContentsReportable Operating SegmentsThe following table sets forth information related to our reportable operating segments, including a comparison of revenues and operating income by segment: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, % Change Constant  Currency% Change (1) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Q3 2018-2017 YTD 2018-2017 Q3 2018-2017 YTD 2018-2017 (in thousands)  Revenues:               Americas$136,957 $120,459 $398,549 $374,336 13.7 % 6.5 % 15.4% (0.6)%Asia Pacific (2)75,163 75,320 288,645 278,656 (0.2)% 3.6 % 1.6% 3.1 %Europe (2)47,419 47,240 182,889 170,864 0.4 % 7.0 % 3.2% 6.1 %  Total segment revenues259,539 243,019 870,083 823,856 6.8 % 5.6 % 8.7% 8.6 %Other businesses1,525 254 2,133 545 500.4 % 291.4 % 515.0% 3.1 %Total consolidated revenues$261,064 $243,273 $872,216 $824,401 7.3 % 5.8 % 9.3% 2.0 %                Income from operations: (3)               Americas$42,586 $24,398 $110,814 $81,132 74.5 % 36.6 % 78.0% 37.6 %Asia Pacific (2)16,861 14,115 74,640 70,880 19.5 % 5.3 % 28.9% 10.5 %Europe (2)12,064 4,870 53,819 35,182 147.7 % 53.0 % 139.7% 29.0 %Total segment income from operations71,511 43,383 239,273 187,194 64.8 % 27.8 % 69.0% 25.7 %Other businesses(4)(14,092) (6,233) (41,557) (16,883) (126.1)% (146.1)% 70.0% 149.6 %Unallocated corporate and other (5)(43,524) (34,465) (120,835) (122,598) (26.3)% 1.4 % 4.2% (70.7)%Total consolidated income from operations$13,895 $2,685 $76,881 $47,713 417.5 % 61.1 % 898.1% 229.7 %(1) Reflects year over year change as if the current period results were in constant currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.

The adjustments for this revision had the following impacts: Asia Pacific comparable retail stores decreased by 0.1%; Europe comparable retail stores increased by 0.2%; Asia Pacific direct to consumer comparable store sales increased by 0.2%; Europe direct to consumer comparable store sales decreased by 0.1%.34Table of ContentsFinancial Condition, Capital Resources, and LiquidityLiquidityOur liquidity position as of September 30, 2018 was:  September 30, 2018  (in thousands)Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $207,198Available borrowings 99,400As of September 30, 2018, we had $207.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and up to $99.4 million of remaining availability under our revolving credit facilities. We believe that cash flows from operations, our cash and cash equivalents on hand, and available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and other financing instruments will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. Additional future financing may be necessary to fund our operations and there can be no assurance that, if needed, we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term, the success of our operations, the global economic outlook, and the pace of sustainable growth in our markets, among other factors, could impact our business and liquidity. Due to the seasonal nature of our footwear, which is more heavily focused on styles suitable for warm weather, cash flows from operating activities during our first quarter are typically lower as customer receivables and inventories rise in preparation for the Spring/Summer season. Cash flows from operating generated during our second and third quarters are generally higher, when the northern hemisphere is experiencing warmer weather. Accordingly, results of operations and cash flows for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of expected results for any other quarter or for any other year.Repatriation of CashAs a global business, we have cash balances in various countries and amounts are denominated in various currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations and cash positions. Future fluctuations in foreign currencies may have a material impact on our cash flows and capital resources. Cash balances held in foreign countries may have additional restrictions and covenants associated with them which could adversely impact our liquidity and our ability to timely access and transfer cash balances between entities.As a result of the Tax Act, most of the cash held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. In some countries, repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws and could have adverse tax consequences if we were to move the cash to another country. As of September 30, 2018, we held $109.4 million of our total $203.0 million in cash in international locations. This cash is primarily used for the ongoing operations of the business in the locations in which the cash is held. Of the $109.4 million, repatriation of $0.8 million could potentially be limited by local regulations. If the remaining $108.6 million were to be immediately repatriated to the U.S., no additional U.S. federal income tax expense would be incurred. Senior Revolving Credit Facility In order to provide additional liquidity in the future and to help support our strategic goals, our senior revolving credit facility (the “Facility”), pursuant to an Amended and Restated Credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), provides for borrowings of up to $100.0 million through February 2021. The Facility contains financial covenants that restrict certain actions by us, including limitations on: (i) stock repurchases to $100.0 million per year, subject to certain restrictions; and (ii) capital expenditures and commitments to $50.0 million per year. The Credit Agreement also permits intercompany loans of up to $375.0 million and requires the Company to meet certain financial covenant ratios that become effective when average outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, including letters of credit, exceed the lesser of $40.0 million or 40% of the total commitments during certain periods or if the outstanding borrowings exceed the borrowing base. If the financial covenant ratios are in effect, the Company must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.As of September 30, 2018, the total commitments available from the lenders under the Facility were $100.0 million. At September 30, 2018, the Company had no outstanding borrowings and $0.6 million in outstanding letters of credit under the 35Table of ContentsFacility, which reduces amounts available for borrowing under the Facility. As of September 30, 2018, the Company had $99.4 million of available borrowing capacity under the Facility. The Facility matures in February 2021.On November 5, 2018, the Company entered into the Sixteenth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which, among other things: (i) increased the total commitments under the Credit Agreement to $150.0 million from $100.0 million; (ii) increased permitted stock repurchases to $200.0 million from $100.0 million per year; (iii) increased total permitted stock repurchases to $800.0 million from $600.0 million cumulatively; and (iv) added an additional lender under the Credit Agreement.Asia Revolving Credit Facilities The Company’s revolving credit facility agreement with HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch (“HSBC”), or the “HSBC Facility,” provides the Company uncommitted dual currency revolving loan facilities of up to 40.0 million Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”), or $5.8 million, with a combined facility limit of RMB 60.0 million, or $8.7 million. The HSBC Facility may be canceled at any time by either party. As of September 30, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding and borrowings under the HSBC Facility remained suspended at the discretion of HSBC.In January 2018, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility with China Merchants Bank Company Limited, Shanghai Branch, or the “CMBC Facility,” which provides the Company a revolving loan facility of up to 30.0 million RMB, or $4.4 million, subject to consent by the lender. The CMBC Facility matures in January 2019. For RMB loans under the CMBC Facility, interest is based on a benchmark interest rate plus a certain number of basis points upon agreement by the lender and the Company at the time of borrowing. The CMBC Facility may be canceled or suspended at any time by either party. As of September 30, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding on this credit facility.Cash Flows Nine Months Ended September 30,   2018 2017 $ Change % Change (in thousands)  Cash provided by operating activities$85,870 $80,415 $5,455 6.8 %Cash used in investing activities(3,899) (12,701) 8,802 69.3 %Cash used in financing activities(46,695) (37,600) (9,095) (24.2)%Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash(5,133) 499 (5,632) 1,128.7 %Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$30,143 $30,613 $(470) (1.5)%Operating Activities. Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities, consisting of net income adjusted for noncash items and changes in working capital. Cash provided by operating activities increased $5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted from the combined impacts of an increase in net income as adjusted for non-cash items, which resulted in a favorable change of $32.3 million, and an unfavorable change in our operating assets and liabilities of $26.8 million. The favorable change in net income adjusted for non-cash items was driven primarily by higher net income of $26.7 million, as well as higher non-cash stock-based compensation, offset in part by a gain in unrealized foreign currency compared to a loss in 2017, and lower depreciation and amortization expenses. Higher accounts receivable, reflective of higher revenues, drove a use of cash $28.3 million higher compared to 2017. Changes in inventories were an $8.0 million use of cash compared to the same period in 2017. Changes in prepaid expenses and other assets contributed an additional use of cash of $7.7 million compared to 2017. Increased accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities at September 30, 2018 compared to September 30, 2017, were a source of $17.2 million in cash as we improved our cash management. Investing Activities. The $8.8 million decrease in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017 is due to lower net capital asset expenditures, as we are opening fewer new stores and remodeling fewer stores each year as our retail fleet is reduced. Capital spend during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 related primarily to information technology investment and distribution center and retail store improvements.Financing Activities. The $9.1 million increase in cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017 resulted primarily from repurchase of 2.4 million shares of our common stock for approximately $37.0 million compared to 3.3 million shares for approximately $25.6 million in the first nine months of 36Table of Contents2017 and net repayments on borrowings of $0.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $2.7 million for the same period in 2017. Our net borrowings decreased in both the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 as we financed more of our short-term cash requirements from internal cash generated from operations.Contractual ObligationsThere have been no significant changes to the contractual obligations reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2018, other than certain operating lease and purchase commitments, which are described in Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. As of January 1, 2018, we adopted authoritative guidance related to revenue recognition from contracts with customers using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements was not restated and is reported under the accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. The adoption of this guidance did not have, and is not expected to have, a significant impact on our reported revenues, gross margins or income from operations. We changed our balance sheet presentation for expected product returns by reporting a product return asset for the right to receive returned products and a returns liability for amounts expected to be refunded to customers as a result of product returns. The product return asset is reported within ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’. The returns liability and payments received from customers for future delivery of products are reported within ‘Accrued liabilities and other expenses’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company changed its inventory costing method for approximately 95% of its inventories from a lower of net realizable value or cost, using a moving average cost method, to lower of net realizable value or cost using a first-in-first-out method. The change from the Company’s former inventory cost method did not have a significant effect on inventory or cost of sales, and, as a result, prior comparative financial statements have not been restated. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and Note 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements — Revenue Recognition contained in the condensed consolidated financial statements in this report. There have been no other significant changes in our critical accounting policies or their application since December 31, 2017.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, and issued accounting pronouncements that we believe may have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when adopted.37Table of ContentsITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate Risk We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our Facility and certain financial instruments. Borrowings under our Facility bear interest at a variable rate and are therefore subject to risk based upon prevailing market interest rates. Interest rates fluctuate as a result of many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under our Facility.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskAs a global company, we have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. We are exposed to the risk of gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities within our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary’s functional currency. Likewise, our U.S. companies are also exposed to the risk of gains and losses and the resulting changes in exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar.We have experienced and will continue to experience changes in international currency rates, impacting both results of operations and the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to buy or sell various foreign currencies to selectively protect against volatility in the value of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings in the period that the changes occur. As of September 30, 2018, the U.S. Dollar notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts was approximately $270.2 million. The net fair value of these contracts at September 30, 2018 was an asset of $0.6 million. We perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts. To perform the sensitivity analysis, we assess the risk of changes in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by the foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the U.S. Dollar. As of September 30, 2018, a 10% appreciation in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a net increase in the fair value of our derivative portfolio of approximately $3.0 million. Effects of Changes in Exchange Rates on Translated Results of International Subsidiaries Changes in exchange rates have a direct effect on our reported U.S. Dollar consolidated financial statements because we translate the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries to U.S. Dollars using current period exchange rates. Specifically, we translate the statements of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into the U.S. Dollar reporting currency using exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. As a result, comparisons of reported results between reporting periods may be impacted significantly due to differences in the exchange rates used to translate the operating results of our international subsidiaries. For example, in our Europe operating segment, when the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to the Euro, our reported U.S. Dollar results are lower than if there had been no change in the exchange rate, because more Euros are required to generate the same U.S. Dollar translated amount. Conversely, when the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to the Euro, the reported U.S. Dollar results of our Europe operating segment are higher compared to a period with a stronger U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro. Similarly, the reported U.S. Dollar results of our Asia Pacific operating segment, where the functional currencies are primarily the Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, Korean Won and the Singapore Dollar, are comparatively lower or higher when the U.S. Dollar strengthens or weakens, respectively, relative to these currencies.An increase of 1% of the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies would have decreased our income before taxes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 by approximately $0.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The volatility of the exchange rates is dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. See Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part I of this Form 10-Q for a discussion of the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates on our U.S. Dollar condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.38Table of ContentsITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such item is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2018, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures that, by their nature, can only provide reasonable assurance regarding management’s control objectives.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the three months ended September 30, 2018, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.39Table of ContentsPART II — Other Information ITEM 1. Legal ProceedingsThe Company was subjected to an audit by the Brazilian Federal Tax Authorities related to imports of footwear from China between 2010 and 2014. On January 13, 2015, the Company was notified about the issuance of assessments totaling 14.4 million Brazilian Real (“BRL”), or approximately $3.6 million, plus interest and penalties, for the period January 2010 through May 2011. The Company has disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to the claims. On February 25, 2015, the Company received additional assessments totaling 33.3 million BRL, or approximately $8.2 million, plus interest and penalties, related to the remainder of the audit period. The Company has also disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to these claims in administrative appeals. On August 29, 2017, the Company received a favorable ruling on its appeal of the first assessment, which dismissed all fines, penalties, and interest. The tax authorities have requested a special appeal to that decision. If the appeal is accepted, Crocs will have the opportunity to both defend the appeal as well as challenge it procedurally. Should the Brazilian Tax Authority prevail in this final administrative appeal, Crocs may still challenge the assessments through the court system, which would likely require the posting of a bond. Additionally, the second appeal for the remaining assessments was heard on March 22, 2018. That decision was partially favorable and resulted in approximately a 38% reduction in principal, penalties, and interest, leaving approximately $5.1 million, plus interest and penalties, at risk for those assessments. The tax authorities have appealed that decision. Crocs intends to file a response to the tax authorities’ appeal as well as a separate appeal against the unfavorable portion of the ruling.Although we are subject to other litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including employment, intellectual property and product liability claims, we are not party to any other pending legal proceedings that we believe would reasonably have a material adverse impact on our business, financial results, and cash flows.

As of September 30, 2018, approximately $181.8 million remained available for repurchase under our share repurchase authorization. The number, price, structure and timing of the repurchases, if any, will be at our sole discretion and future repurchases will be evaluated by us depending on market conditions, liquidity needs, restrictions under our debt arrangements, and other factors. Share repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and does not oblige us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. The Board may suspend, modify, or terminate the repurchase program at any time without prior notice.40Table of ContentsITEM 5.

In such event:(A)The Administrative Agent and the Borrowers shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect the replacement index, the adjusted margins and such other related amendments as may be appropriate, in the reasonable discretion of the Administrative Agent, for the implementation and administration of the replacement index-based rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, Section 11.2), such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement at 5:00 p.m. on the tenth (10th) Business Day after the date a draft of the amendment is provided to the Lenders, unless the Administrative Agent receives, on or before such tenth (10th) Business Day, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that such Lenders object to such amendment.(B)Selection of the replacement index, adjustments to the applicable margins, and amendments to this Agreement (I) will be determined with due consideration to the then-current market practices for determining and implementing a rate of interest for newly originated loans in the United States and loans converted from a LIBOR Rate-based rate to a replacement index-based rate, and (II) may also reflect adjustments to account for (x) the effects of the transition from the LIBOR Rate to the replacement index and (y) yield- or risk-based differences between the LIBOR Rate and the replacement index.(C)Until an amendment reflecting a new replacement index in accordance with this Section 4.4.1(iii) is effective, each advance, conversion and renewal of a Loan to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies will continue to bear interest with reference to the LIBOR Rate; provided however, that if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be final and conclusive, absent manifest error) that a LIBOR Termination Date has occurred, then following the LIBOR Termination Date, all Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies shall automatically be converted to the Base Rate Option until such time as an amendment reflecting a replacement index and related matters as described above is implemented. In the event that the Required Lenders have provided a written notice pursuant to Section 4.4.1(iii)(A) objecting to an amendment, the Lenders agree to work with the Borrower in good faith to timely determine and implement the replacement index-based rate.(D)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time the replacement index is less than zero, at such times, such index shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of this Agreement.(q)    Certificate of Beneficial Ownership and Other Additional Information. The following Section 8.1.11 is hereby added to the Credit Agreement:8.1.11.     Certificate of Beneficial Ownership and Other Additional Information.

Each Lender shall remit the principal amount of each Revolving Credit Loan to the Administrative Agent such that the Administrative Agent is able to, and the Administrative Agent shall, to the extent the Lenders have made funds available to it for such purpose and subject to Section 7.2 [Each Loan or Letter of Credit], fund such Revolving Credit Loans to the Borrower in U.S. Dollars and immediately available funds at the Principal Office prior to 3:00 p.m., on the applicable Borrowing Date; provided that if any Lender fails to remit such funds to the Administrative Agent in a timely manner, the Administrative Agent may elect in its sole discretion to fund with its own funds the Revolving Credit Loans of such Lender on such Borrowing Date, and such Lender shall be subject to the repayment obligation in Section 2.5.2 [Presumptions by the Administrative Agent].2.5.2    Presumptions by the Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Loan that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Loan, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.5.1 [Making Revolving Credit Loans] and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Loan available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Loans under the Base Rate Option; provided, however, that Agent shall first make demand for repayment upon such Lender prior to making demand on Borrowers.

Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall bear interest at the Base Rate Option and shall be deemed to have been properly requested in accordance with Section 2.4.1 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests] without regard to any of the requirements of that provision. PNC shall provide notice to the Lenders (which may be telephonic or written notice by letter, facsimile or telex) that such Revolving Credit Loans are to be made under this Section 2.5.5 and of the apportionment among the Lenders, and the Lenders shall be unconditionally obligated to fund such Revolving Credit Loans (whether or not the conditions specified in Section 2.4.1 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests] are then satisfied) by the time PNC so requests, which shall not be earlier than 3:00 p.m. on the Business Day next after the date the Lenders receive such notice from PNC. 2.5.6    Swing Loans Under Cash Management Agreements.

The Borrower shall also pay to the Issuing Lender for the Issuing Lender’s sole account the Issuing Lender’s then in effect customary fees and administrative expenses payable with respect to the Letters of Credit as the Issuing Lender may generally charge or incur from time to time in connection with the issuance, maintenance, amendment (if any), assignment or transfer (if any), negotiation, and administration of Letters of Credit.2.8.3    Disbursements, Reimbursement. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Lender a participation in such Letter of Credit and each drawing thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender’s Ratable Share of the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively.2.8.3.1    In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Provided that it shall have received such notice, the Borrower shall reimburse (such obligation to reimburse the Issuing Lender shall sometimes be referred to as a “Reimbursement Obligation”) the Issuing Lender prior to 12:00 noon on each date that an amount is paid by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit (each such date, a “Drawing Date”) by paying to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender an amount equal to the amount so paid by the Issuing Lender. In the event the Borrower fails to reimburse the Issuing Lender (through the Administrative Agent) for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by 12:00 noon on the Drawing Date, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender thereof, and the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested that Revolving Credit Loans be made by the Lenders under the Base Rate Option to be disbursed on the Drawing Date under such Letter of Credit, subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Loan or Letter of Credit] other than any notice requirements. Any notice given by the Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.8.3.1 may be oral if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.2.8.3.2    Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.8.3.1 make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender an amount in immediately available funds equal to its Ratable Share of the amount of the drawing, whereupon the participating Lenders shall (subject to Section 2.8.3 [Disbursement; Reimbursement]) each be deemed to have made a Revolving Credit Loan under the Base Rate Option to the Borrower in that amount. If any Lender so notified fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender the amount of such Lender’s Ratable Share of such amount by no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Drawing Date, then interest shall accrue on such Lender’s obligation to make such payment, from the Drawing Date to the date on which such Lender makes such payment (i) at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate during the first three (3) days following the Drawing Date and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to Loans under the Revolving Credit Base Rate Option on and after the fourth day following the Drawing Date. The Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender will promptly give notice (as described in Section 2.8.3.1 above) of the occurrence of the Drawing Date, but failure of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender to give any such notice on the Drawing Date or in sufficient time to enable any Lender to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Lender from its obligation under this Section 2.8.3.2.2.8.3.3    With respect to any unreimbursed drawing that is not converted into Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option to the Borrower in whole or in part as contemplated by Section 2.8.3.1, because of the Borrower’s failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Loan or Letter of Credit] other than any notice requirements, or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the Issuing Lender a borrowing (each a “Letter of Credit Borrowing”) in the amount of such drawing. Such Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option. Each Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.8.3 [Disbursements, Reimbursement] shall be deemed to be a payment in respect of its participation in such Letter of Credit Borrowing (each a “Participation Advance”) from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.8.3.2.8.4    Repayment of Participation Advances.2.8.4.1    Upon (and only upon) receipt by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender of immediately available funds from the Borrower (i) in reimbursement of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under the Letter of Credit with respect to which any Lender has made a Participation Advance to the Administrative Agent, or (ii) in payment of interest on such a payment made by the Issuing Lender under such a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Issuing Lender will pay to each Lender, in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent, the amount of such Lender’s Ratable Share of such funds, except the Administrative Agent shall retain for the account of the Issuing Lender the amount of the Ratable Share of such funds of any Lender that did not make a Participation Advance in respect of such payment by the Issuing Lender.2.8.4.2    If the Administrative Agent is required at any time to return to any Loan Party, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or any official in any Insolvency Proceeding, any portion of any payment made by any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section in reimbursement of a payment made under the Letter of Credit or interest or fee thereon, each Lender shall, on demand of the Administrative Agent, forthwith return to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender the amount of its Ratable Share of any amounts so returned by the Administrative Agent plus interest thereon from the date such demand is made to the date such amounts are returned by such Lender to the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect from time to time.2.8.5    Documentation.  Each Loan Party agrees to be bound by the terms of the Issuing Lender’s application and agreement for letters of credit and the Issuing Lender’s written regulations and customary practices relating to letters of credit, though such interpretation may be different from such Loan Party’s own. In the event of a conflict between such application or agreement and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. It is understood and agreed that, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Issuing Lender shall not be liable for any error, negligence and/or mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in following any Loan Party’s instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or any modifications, amendments or supplements thereto.2.8.6    Determinations to Honor Drawing Requests.  In determining whether to honor any request for drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Lender shall be responsible only to determine that the documents and certificates required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit have been delivered and that they comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit.2.8.7    Nature of Participation and Reimbursement Obligations.  Each Lender’s obligation in accordance with this Agreement to make the Revolving Credit Loans or Participation Advances, as contemplated by Section 2.8.3 [Disbursements, Reimbursement], as a result of a drawing under a Letter of Credit, and the Obligations of the Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Lender upon a draw under a Letter of Credit, shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.8 under all circumstances, including the following circumstances:(i)    any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Issuing Lender or any of its Affiliates, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, or which any Loan Party may have against the Issuing Lender or any of its Affiliates, any Lender or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii)    the failure of any Loan Party or any other Person to comply, in connection with a Letter of Credit Borrowing, with the conditions set forth in Sections 2.1 [Revolving Credit Commitments], 2.4 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests; Swing Loan Requests], 2.5 [Making Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Loans; Etc.] or 7.2 [Each Loan or Letter of Credit] or as otherwise set forth in this Agreement for the making of a Revolving Credit Loan, it being acknowledged that such conditions are not required for the making of a Letter of Credit Borrowing and the obligation of the Lenders to make Participation Advances under Section 2.8.3 [Disbursements, Reimbursement];(iii)    any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit;(iv)    any claim of breach of warranty that might be made by any Loan Party or any Lender against any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit, or the existence of any claim, set-off, recoupment, counterclaim, crossclaim, defense or other right which any Loan Party or any Lender may have at any time against a beneficiary, successor beneficiary any transferee or assignee of any Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof (or any Persons for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates or any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including any underlying transaction between any Loan Party or Subsidiaries of a Loan Party and the beneficiary for which any Letter of Credit was procured);(v)    the lack of power or authority of any signer of (or any defect in or forgery of any signature or endorsement on) or the form of or lack of validity, sufficiency, accuracy, enforceability or genuineness of any draft, demand, instrument, certificate or other document presented under or in connection with any Letter of Credit, or any fraud or alleged fraud in connection with any Letter of Credit, or the transport of any property or provision of services relating to a Letter of Credit, in each case even if the Issuing Lender or any of its Affiliates has been notified thereof;(vi)    payment by the Issuing Lender or any of its Affiliates under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other document which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;(vii)    the solvency of, or any acts or omissions by, any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit, or any other Person having a role in any transaction or obligation relating to a Letter of Credit, or the existence, nature, quality, quantity, condition, value or other characteristic of any property or services relating to a Letter of Credit;(viii)    any failure by the Issuing Lender or any of its Affiliates to issue any Letter of Credit in the form requested by any Loan Party, unless the Issuing Lender has received written notice from such Loan Party of such failure within three Business Days after the Issuing Lender shall have furnished such Loan Party and the Administrative Agent a copy of such Letter of Credit and such error is material and no drawing has been made thereon prior to receipt of such notice;(ix)    any adverse change in the business, operations, properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of any Loan Party or Subsidiaries of a Loan Party;(x)    any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by any party thereto;(xi)    the occurrence or continuance of an Insolvency Proceeding with respect to any Loan Party;(xii)    the fact that an Event of Default or a Potential Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (xiii)    the fact that the Expiration Date shall have passed or this Agreement or the Commitments hereunder shall have been terminated; and(xiv)    any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. 2.8.8    Indemnity.  The Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save harmless the Issuing Lender and any of its Affiliates that has issued a Letter of Credit from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, taxes, penalties, interest, judgments, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel) which the Issuing Lender or any of its Affiliates may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of the issuance of any Letter of Credit, other than as a result of (A) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (B) the wrongful dishonor by the Issuing Lender or any of Issuing Lender’s Affiliates of a proper demand for payment made under any Letter of Credit, except if such dishonor resulted from any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto government or Official Body.2.8.9    Liability for Acts and Omissions.  As between any Loan Party and the Issuing Lender, or the Issuing Lender’s Affiliates, such Loan Party assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for any of the following, including any losses or damages to any Loan Party or other Person or property relating therefrom: (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for an issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged (even if the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates shall have been notified thereof); (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) the failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit, or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred, to comply fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit or any other claim of any Loan Party against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, or any such transferee, or any dispute between or among any Loan Party and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any such transferee; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates, as applicable, including any act or omission of any Official Body, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of the Issuing Lender’s or its Affiliates rights or powers hereunder. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall relieve the Issuing Lender from liability for the Issuing Lender’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with actions or omissions described in such clauses (i) through (viii) of such sentence. In no event shall the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates be liable to any Loan Party for any indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or special damages or expenses (including without limitation attorneys’ fees), or for any damages resulting from any change in the value of any property relating to a Letter of Credit. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Issuing Lender and each of its Affiliates (i) may rely on any oral or other communication believed in good faith by the Issuing Lender or such Affiliate to have been authorized or given by or on behalf of the applicant for a Letter of Credit, (ii) may honor any presentation if the documents presented appear on their face substantially to comply with the terms and conditions of the relevant Letter of Credit; (iii) may honor a previously dishonored presentation under a Letter of Credit, whether such dishonor was pursuant to a court order, to settle or compromise any claim of wrongful dishonor, or otherwise, and shall be entitled to reimbursement to the same extent as if such presentation had initially been honored, together with any interest paid by the Issuing Lender or its Affiliate; (iv) may honor any drawing that is payable upon presentation of a statement advising negotiation or payment, upon receipt of such statement (even if such statement indicates that a draft or other document is being delivered separately), and shall not be liable for any failure of any such draft or other document to arrive, or to conform in any way with the relevant Letter of Credit; (v) may pay any paying or negotiating bank claiming that it rightfully honored under the laws or practices of the place where such bank is located; and (vi) may settle or adjust any claim or demand made on the Issuing Lender or its Affiliate in any way related to any order issued at the applicant’s request to an air carrier, a letter of guarantee or of indemnity issued to a carrier or any similar document (each an “Order”) and honor any drawing in connection with any Letter of Credit that is the subject of such Order, notwithstanding that any drafts or other documents presented in connection with such Letter of Credit fail to conform in any way with such Letter of Credit.In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions set forth above, any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates under any resulting liability to the Borrower or any Lender.2.8.10    Issuing Lender Reporting Requirements.  Each Issuing Lender shall, on the first Business Day of each month, provide to Administrative Agent and Borrower a schedule of the Letters of Credit issued by it, in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent, showing the date of issuance of each Letter of Credit, the account party, the original face amount (if any), and the expiration date of any Letter of Credit outstanding at any time during the preceding month, and any other information relating to such Letter of Credit that the Administrative Agent may request.2.9    Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:(i)    fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.3 [Commitment Fees];(ii)    the Commitment and outstanding Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 11.2 [Modifications, Amendments or Waivers]); provided, that this clause (ii) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification that increases the Commitments of such Lender, provides for an extension of the Expiration Date for such Lender’s Loans, or alters the definition of Required Lenders; (iii)    if any Swing Loans are outstanding or any Letter of Credit Obligations exist at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then:(a)    all or any part of the outstanding Swing Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Ratable Shares but only to the extent that (x) the Revolving Facility Usage does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Credit Commitments, and (y) no Potential Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time;(b)     if the reallocation described in clause (a) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such outstanding Swing Loans, and (y) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Lender the Borrower’s obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Obligations (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (a) above) in a deposit account held at the Administrative Agent for so long as such Letter of Credit Obligations are outstanding; (c)    if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Obligations pursuant to clause (b) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.8.2 [Letter of Credit Fees] with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Obligations during the period such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Obligations are cash collateralized; (d)    if the Letter of Credit Obligations of the non-Defaulting Lenders are reallocated pursuant to clause (a) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.8.2 shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders’ Ratable Share; and(e)    if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Obligations are neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (a) or (b) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Lender or any other Lender hereunder, all Letter of Credit Fees payable under Section 2.8.2 with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Obligations shall be payable to the Issuing Lender (and not to such Defaulting Lender) until and to the extent that such Letter of Credit Obligations are reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and(iv)    so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, PNC shall not be required to fund any Swing Loans and the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless such Issuing Lender is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender’s then outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations will be 100% covered by the Revolving Credit Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.9(iii), and participating interests in any newly made Swing Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.9(iii)(a) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein). If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to any Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue, or (ii) PNC or the Issuing Lender has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, PNC shall not be required to fund any Swing Loan and the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless PNC or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender, satisfactory to PNC or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder. The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this Section 2.9 are in addition to other rights and remedies which the Borrower may have against such Defaulting Lender and which the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender in each case under applicable Law.In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, PNC and the Issuing Lender agree in writing that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, and the Ratable Share of the Swing Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender’s Commitment, and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swing Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Ratable Share.2.10    Increase in Revolving Credit Commitments.2.10.1    Increasing Lenders and New Lenders. The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, request that (1) the current Lenders increase their Revolving Credit Commitments (any current Lender which elects to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment shall be referred to as an “Increasing Lender”) or (2) one or more new lenders (each a “New Lender”) join this Agreement and provide a Revolving Credit Commitment hereunder, subject to the following terms and conditions: (i)    No Obligation to Increase. No current Lender shall be obligated to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment and any increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment by any current Lender shall be in the sole discretion of such current Lender. (ii)    Defaults. There shall exist no Events of Default or Potential Default on the effective date of such increase after giving effect to such increase. (iii)    Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments. After giving effect to such increase, the total Revolving Credit Commitments shall not exceed $125,000,000. (iv)    Resolutions; Opinion. The Loan Parties shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on or before the effective date of such increase the following documents in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent: (1) certifications of their corporate secretaries with attached resolutions certifying that the increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment has been approved by such Loan Parties, and (2) an opinion of counsel addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders addressing the authorization and execution of the Loan Documents by, and enforceability of the Loan Documents against, the Loan Parties. (v)    Notes. The Borrowers shall execute and deliver (1) to each Increasing Lender a replacement revolving credit Note reflecting the new amount of such Increasing Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment after giving effect to the increase (and the prior Note issued to such Increasing Lender shall be deemed to be terminated) and (2) to each New Lender a revolving credit Note reflecting the amount of such New Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment. (vi)    Approval of New Lenders. Any New Lender shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). (vii)    Increasing Lenders. Each Increasing Lender shall confirm its agreement to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to an acknowledgement in a form acceptable to the Administrative Agent, signed by it and the Borrower and delivered to the Administrative Agent at least five (5) calendar days before the effective date of such increase. (viii)    New Lenders--Joinder. Each New Lender shall execute a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent pursuant to which such New Lender shall join and become a party to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with a Revolving Credit Commitment in the amount set forth in such lender joinder.2.11    Reduction of Revolving Credit Commitment. The Borrowers shall have the right at any time after the Closing Date upon five (5) calendar days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period of time agreed to by the Administrative Agent) to permanently reduce (ratably among the Lenders in proportion to their Ratable Shares) the Revolving Credit Commitments, in a minimum amount of $500,000 and whole multiples of $500,000, or to terminate completely the Revolving Credit Commitments, without penalty or premium except as set forth herein, including without limitation, in Section 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender], Section 5.8 [Increased Costs] and Section 5.10 [Indemnity]; provided that any such reduction or termination shall be accompanied by prepayment of the Notes, together with outstanding Commitment Fees, and the full amount of interest accrued on the principal sum to be prepaid (and all amounts referred to in Section 5.10 [Indemnity] hereof) to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate Revolving Facility Usage after giving effect to such prepayments to be equal to or less than the Revolving Credit Commitments as so reduced or terminated. Any notice to reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments under this Section 2.11 shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of all Revolving Credit Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.3.    RESERVED4.    INTEREST RATES4.1    Interest Rate Options.  The Borrower shall pay interest in respect of the outstanding unpaid principal amount of the Loans as selected by it from the Base Rate Option or LIBOR Rate Option set forth below applicable to the Loans, it being understood that, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Borrower may select different Interest Rate Options and different Interest Periods to apply simultaneously to the Loans comprising different Borrowing Tranches and may convert to or renew one or more Interest Rate Options with respect to all or any portion of the Loans comprising any Borrowing Tranche; provided that there shall not be at any one time outstanding more than five (5) Borrowing Tranches in the aggregate among all of the Loans and provided further that if an Event of Default or Potential Default exists and is continuing, the Borrower may not request, convert to, or renew the LIBOR Rate Option for any Loans and the Required Lenders may demand that all existing Borrowing Tranches bearing interest under the LIBOR Rate Option shall be converted immediately to the Base Rate Option, subject to the obligation of the Borrower to pay any indemnity under Section 5.10 [Indemnity] in connection with such conversion. If at any time the designated rate applicable to any Loan made by any Lender exceeds such Lender’s highest lawful rate, the rate of interest on such Lender’s Loan shall be limited to such Lender’s highest lawful rate.4.1.1    Revolving Credit Interest Rate Options; Swing Line Interest Rate.  The Borrower shall have the right to select from the following Interest Rate Options applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans:(i)    Revolving Credit Base Rate Option: A fluctuating rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed) equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, such interest rate to change automatically from time to time effective as of the effective date of each change in the Base Rate; or(ii)    Revolving Credit LIBOR Rate Option: A rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed) equal to the LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin.Subject to Section 4.3 [Interest After Default], only the Base Rate Option applicable to Revolving Credit Loans shall apply to the Swing Loans.4.1.2        [RESERVED]4.1.3    Rate Quotations.  The Borrower may call the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which a Loan Request is to be delivered to receive an indication of the rates then in effect, but it is acknowledged that such projection shall not be binding on the Administrative Agent or the Lenders nor affect the rate of interest which thereafter is actually in effect when the election is made.4.2    Interest Periods.  At any time when the Borrower shall select, convert to or renew a LIBOR Rate Option, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such LIBOR Rate Option by delivering a Loan Request. The notice shall specify an Interest Period during which such Interest Rate Option shall apply. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the following provisions shall apply to any selection of, renewal of, or conversion to a LIBOR Rate Option:4.2.1    Amount of Borrowing Tranche.  Each Borrowing Tranche of Loans under the LIBOR Rate Option shall be in integral multiples of $500,000 and not less than $1,000,000 and4.2.2    Renewals.  In the case of the renewal of a LIBOR Rate Option at the end of an Interest Period, the first day of the new Interest Period shall be the last day of the preceding Interest Period, without duplication in payment of interest for such day.4.3    Interest After Default.  To the extent permitted by Law, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and until such time such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived, and at the discretion of the Administrative Agent or upon written demand by the Required Lenders to the Administrative Agent:4.3.1    Letter of Credit Fees, Interest Rate.  The Letter of Credit Fees and the rate of interest for each Loan otherwise applicable pursuant to Section 2.8.2 [Letter of Credit Fees] or Section 4.1 [Interest Rate Options], respectively, shall be increased by 2.0% per annum;4.3.2    Other Obligations.  Each other Obligation hereunder if not paid when due shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the rate of interest applicable under the Revolving Credit Base Rate Option plus an additional 2.0% per annum from the time such Obligation becomes due and payable and until it is paid in full; and4.3.3    Acknowledgment.  The Borrower acknowledges that the increase in rates referred to in this Section 4.3 reflects, among other things, the fact that such Loans or other amounts have become a substantially greater risk given their default status and that the Lenders are entitled to additional compensation for such risk; and all such interest shall be payable by Borrower upon demand by Administrative Agent.4.4    LIBOR Rate Unascertainable; Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available.4.4.1    Unascertainable.  If on any date on which a LIBOR Rate would otherwise be determined, the Administrative Agent shall have determined that:(i)    adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining such LIBOR Rate, or(ii)    a contingency has occurred which materially and adversely affects the London interbank eurodollar market relating to the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent’s and Lender’s Rights].4.4.2    Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available.  If at any time any Lender shall have determined that:(i)    the making, maintenance or funding of any Loan to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies has been made impracticable or unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any Law or any interpretation or application thereof by any Official Body or with any request or directive of any such Official Body (whether or not having the force of Law), or(ii)    such LIBOR Rate Option will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lender of the establishment or maintenance of any such Loan, or(iii)    after making all reasonable efforts, deposits of the relevant amount in Dollars for the relevant Interest Period for a Loan, or to banks generally, to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies, respectively, are not available to such Lender with respect to such Loan, or to banks generally, in the interbank eurodollar market, then the Administrative Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent’s and Lender’s Rights].4.4.3    Administrative Agent’s and Lender’s Rights.  In the case of any event specified in Section 4.4.1 [Unascertainable] above, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Lenders and the Borrower thereof, and in the case of an event specified in Section 4.4.2 [Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available] above, such Lender shall promptly so notify the Administrative Agent and endorse a certificate to such notice as to the specific circumstances of such notice, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly send copies of such notice and certificate to the other Lenders and the Borrower. Upon such date as shall be specified in such notice (which shall not be earlier than the date such notice is given), the obligation of (A) the Lenders, in the case of such notice given by the Administrative Agent, or (B) such Lender, in the case of such notice given by such Lender, to allow the Borrower to select, convert to or renew a LIBOR Rate Option shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall have later notified the Borrower, or such Lender shall have later notified the Administrative Agent, of the Administrative Agent’s or such Lender’s, as the case may be, determination that the circumstances giving rise to such previous determination no longer exist. If at any time the Administrative Agent makes a determination under Section 4.4.1 [Unascertainable] and the Borrower has previously notified the Administrative Agent of its selection of, conversion to or renewal of a LIBOR Rate Option and such Interest Rate Option has not yet gone into effect, such notification shall be deemed to provide for selection of, conversion to or renewal of the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loans. If any Lender notifies the Administrative Agent of a determination under Section 4.4.2 [Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available], the Borrower shall, subject to the Borrower’s indemnification Obligations under Section 5.10 [Indemnity], as to any Loan of the Lender to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies, on the date specified in such notice either convert such Loan to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan or prepay such Loan in accordance with Section 5.6 [Voluntary Prepayments]. Absent due notice from the Borrower of conversion or prepayment, such Loan shall automatically be converted to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan upon such specified date.4.5    Selection of Interest Rate Options.  If the Borrower fails to select a new Interest Period to apply to any Borrowing Tranche of Loans under the LIBOR Rate Option at the expiration of an existing Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing Tranche in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.2 [Interest Periods], the Borrower shall be deemed to have converted such Borrowing Tranche to the Base Rate Option commencing upon the last day of the existing Interest Period.5.    PAYMENTS5.1    Payments.  All payments and prepayments to be made in respect of principal, interest, Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, Administrative Agent’s Fee or other fees or amounts due from the Borrower hereunder shall be payable prior to 1:00 p.m. on the date when due without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, and without set-off, counterclaim or other deduction of any nature, and an action therefor shall immediately accrue. Such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Principal Office for the account of PNC with respect to the Swing Loans and for the ratable accounts of the Lenders with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans in U.S. Dollars and in immediately available funds, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute such amounts to the Lenders in immediately available funds; provided that in the event payments are received by 1:00 p.m. by the Administrative Agent with respect to the Loans and such payments are not distributed to the Lenders on the same day received by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall pay the Lenders the Federal Funds Effective Rate with respect to the amount of such payments for each day held by the Administrative Agent and not distributed to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent’s and each Lender’s statement of account, ledger or other relevant record shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive as the statement of the amount of principal of and interest on the Loans and other amounts owing under this Agreement and shall be deemed an “account stated.”5.2    Pro Rata Treatment of Lenders.  Each borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans shall be allocated to each Lender according to its Ratable Share, and each selection of, conversion to or renewal of any Interest Rate Option and each payment or prepayment by the Borrower with respect to principal, interest, Commitment Fees and Letter of Credit Fees (but excluding the Administrative Agent’s Fee and the Issuing Lender’s fronting fee) shall (except as otherwise may be provided with respect to a Defaulting Lender and except as provided in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent’s and Lender’s Rights] in the case of an event specified in Section 4.4 [LIBOR Rate Unascertainable; Etc.], 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender] or 5.8 [Increased Costs]) be payable ratably among the Lenders entitled to such payment in accordance with the amount of principal, interest, Commitment Fees, Facility Fees and Letter of Credit Fees, as set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each borrowing or payment or prepayment by the Borrower of principal, interest, fees or other amounts from the Borrower with respect to Swing Loans shall be made by or to PNC according to Section 2.5.5 [Borrowings to Repay Swing Loans].5.3    Sharing of Payments by Lenders.  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff, counterclaim or banker’s lien, by receipt of voluntary payment, by realization upon security, or by any other non-pro rata source, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender’s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than the pro-rata share of the amount such Lender is entitled thereto, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:(i)    if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, together with interest or other amounts, if any, required by Law (including court order) to be paid by the Lender or the holder making such purchase; and(ii)    the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Loan Parties pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of the Loan Documents or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or Participation Advances to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall apply).Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation but without duplication as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Loan Party in the amount of such participation.5.4    Presumptions by Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.5.5    Interest Payment Dates.  Interest on Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies shall be due and payable in arrears on each Payment Date. Interest on Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies shall be due and payable on the last day of each Interest Period for those Loans. Interest on mandatory prepayments of principal under Section 5.7 [Mandatory Prepayments] shall be due on the date such mandatory prepayment is due. Interest on the principal amount of each Loan or other monetary Obligation shall be due and payable on demand after such principal amount or other monetary Obligation becomes due and payable (whether on the stated Expiration Date, upon acceleration or otherwise).5.6    Voluntary Prepayments.5.6.1    Right to Prepay.  The Borrower shall have the right at its option from time to time to prepay the Loans in whole or part without premium or penalty (except as provided in Section 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender] below, in Section 5.8 [Increased Costs] and Section 5.10 [Indemnity]). Whenever the Borrower desires to prepay any part of the Loans, it shall provide a prepayment notice to the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of prepayment of the Revolving Credit Loans or no later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of prepayment of Swing Loans, setting forth the following information:(w)    the date, which shall be a Business Day, on which the proposed prepayment is to be made;(x)    a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between the Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Loans;(y)    a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies and Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies; and(z)    the total principal amount of such prepayment, which shall not be less than the lesser of (i) the Revolving Facility Usage or (ii) $500,000 for any Swing Loan or $500,000 for any Revolving Credit Loan.All prepayment notices shall be irrevocable; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of all Revolving Credit Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.11 [Reduction of Revolving Credit Commitment], then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.11 [Reduction of Revolving Credit Commitment]. The principal amount of the Loans for which a prepayment notice is given, together with interest on such principal amount except with respect to Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, shall be due and payable on the date specified in such prepayment notice as the date on which the proposed prepayment is to be made. Except as provided in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agent’s and Lender’s Rights], if the Borrower prepays a Loan but fails to specify the applicable Borrowing Tranche which the Borrower is prepaying, the prepayment shall be applied first to Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, then to Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies. Any prepayment hereunder shall be subject to the Borrower’s Obligation to indemnify the Lenders under Section 5.10 [Indemnity].5.6.2    Replacement of a Lender.  In the event any Lender (i) gives notice under Section 4.4 [LIBOR Rate Unascertainable, Etc.], (ii) requests compensation under Section 5.8 [Increased Costs], or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Official Body for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.9 [Taxes], (iii) is a Defaulting Lender, (iv) becomes subject to the control of an Official Body (other than normal and customary supervision), or (v) is a Non-Consenting Lender referred to in Section 11.2 [Modifications, Amendments or Waivers], then in any such event the Borrower may, at its sole expense, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.9 [Successors and Assigns]), all of its interests, rights (other than existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 5.8 [Increased Costs] or 5.9 [Taxes]) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:(i)    the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 11.9 [Successors and Assigns];(ii)    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and Participation Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 5.10 [Indemnity]) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);(iii)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 5.8.1 [Increased Costs Generally] or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 5.9 [Taxes], such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and(iv)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable Law. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.5.7    Mandatory Prepayments.5.7.1    Sale of Assets.  Within five (5) Business Days (or upon receipt if later, but in no event to exceed seventy five (75) after receipt) of any sale of assets authorized by Sections 8.2.7(vi), (v) and (vii) [Disposition of Assets or Subsidiaries], the Borrower shall make a mandatory prepayment of principal on the Revolving Loans equal to the sum of the after-tax proceeds (as estimated in good faith by the Borrower) less any reasonable commissions and other reasonable and customary transaction costs, fees and expenses properly attributable to such sales, subject to Borrowers’ ability to reborrow Revolving Loans in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. 5.7.2    Application Among Interest Rate Options.  All prepayments required pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall first be applied among the Interest Rate Options to the principal amount of the Loans subject to the Base Rate Option, then to Loans subject to a LIBOR Rate Option. In accordance with Section 5.10 [Indemnity], the Borrower shall indemnify the Lenders for any loss or expense, including loss of margin, incurred with respect to any such prepayments applied against Loans subject to a LIBOR Rate Option on any day other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period.5.8    Increased Costs.5.8.1    Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall: (i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the LIBOR Rate) or the Issuing Lender; (ii)    subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (ii) through (iv) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or(iii)    impose on any Lender, the Issuing Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, the Issuing Lender or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, the Issuing Lender or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Issuing Lender or other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, the Issuing Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 5.8.2    Capital Requirements.  If any Lender or the Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the Issuing Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 5.8.3    Certificates for Reimbursement; Repayment of Outstanding Loans; Borrowing of New Loans.  A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Sections 5.8.1 [Increased Costs Generally] or 5.8.2 [Capital Requirements] and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. 5.8.4    Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the one hundred eighty (180) calendar day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).5.9    Taxes. 5.9.1    Issuing Lender. For purposes of this Section 5.9, the term “Lender” includes the Issuing Lender.5.9.2    Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Law. If any applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Official Body in accordance with applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 5.9 [Taxes]) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.5.9.3    Payment of Other Taxes by the Loan Parties.  The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Official Body in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.5.9.4    Indemnification by the Loan Parties.  The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 5.9 [Taxes]) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable and documented expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Official Body. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 5.9.5    Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of any of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.9.4 [Participations] relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register, and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Official Body. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 5.9.5 [Indemnification by the Lenders]. 5.9.6    Evidence of Payments.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to an Official Body pursuant to this Section 5.9 [Taxes], such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Official Body evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 5.9.7    Status of Lenders.  (i)    Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 5.9.7(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.(ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person. (A)    any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;(B)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (i)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;(ii)    executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; (iii)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit 5.9.7(A) to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or (iv)    to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit 5.9.7(B) or Exhibit 5.9.7(C), IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit 5.9.7(D) on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and(D)    if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.Upon reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 5.9.7. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly (and in any event within twenty (20) calendar days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.5.9.8    Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.9 [Taxes] (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 5.9 [Taxes]), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 5.9 [Taxes] with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Official Body with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party incurred in connection with obtaining such refund, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 5.9.8 [Treatment of Certain Refunds] (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Official Body) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Official Body. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.9.8 [Treatment of Certain Refunds]), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 5.9.8 [Treatment of Certain Refunds] the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.5.9.9    Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section 5.9 [Taxes] shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations.5.10    Indemnity.  In addition to the compensation or payments required by Section 5.8 [Increased Costs]or Section 5.9 [Taxes], the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against all liabilities, losses or expenses (including loss of anticipated profits, any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan, from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract) which such Lender sustains or incurs as a consequence of any:(i)    payment, prepayment, conversion or renewal of any Loan to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies on a day other than the last day of the corresponding Interest Period (whether or not such payment or prepayment is mandatory, voluntary or automatic and whether or not such payment or prepayment is then due),(ii)    attempt by the Borrower to revoke (expressly, by later inconsistent notices or otherwise) in whole or part any Loan Requests under Section 2.4 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests; Swing Loan Requests] or Section 4.2 [Interest Periods] or notice relating to prepayments under Section 5.6 [Voluntary Prepayments], or(iii)    default by the Borrower in the performance or observance of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including any failure of the Borrower to pay when due (by acceleration or otherwise) any principal, interest, Commitment Fee or any other amount due hereunder.If any Lender sustains or incurs any such loss or expense, it shall promptly upon knowledge of such loss or expense notify the Borrower of the amount determined in good faith by such Lender (which determination may include such assumptions, allocations of costs and expenses and averaging or attribution methods as such Lender shall deem reasonable) to be necessary to indemnify such Lender for such loss or expense. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination. Such amount shall be due and payable by the Borrower to such Lender ten (10) Business Days after such notice is given.5.11    Settlement Date Procedures. In order to minimize the transfer of funds between the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow Swing Loans and PNC may make Swing Loans as provided in Section 2.1.2 [Swing Loan Commitments] hereof during the period between Settlement Dates. The Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of its Ratable Share of the total of the Revolving Credit Loans and the Swing Loans (each a “Required Share”). On such Settlement Date, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent the amount equal to the difference between its Required Share and its Revolving Credit Loans, and the Administrative Agent shall pay to each Lender its Ratable Share of all payments made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans. The Administrative Agent shall also effect settlement in accordance with the foregoing sentence on the proposed Borrowing Dates for Revolving Credit Loans and on Mandatory Prepayment Dates and may at its option effect settlement on any other Business Day. These settlement procedures are established solely as a matter of administrative convenience, and nothing contained in this Section 5.11 shall relieve the Lenders of their obligations to fund Revolving Credit Loans on dates other than a Settlement Date pursuant to Section 2.1.2 [Swing Loan Commitment]. The Administrative Agent may at any time at its option for any reason whatsoever require each Lender to pay immediately to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s Ratable Share of the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and each Lender may at any time require the Administrative Agent to pay immediately to such Lender its Ratable Share of all payments made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans.5.12    Mitigation Obligations. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 5.8, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Official Body for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.9, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or materially reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.8 or 5.9, as the case may be, in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense, (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect and (iv) would not require such Lender to take any action inconsistent with its internal policies or legal or regulatory restrictions.

The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the Issuing Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.10.5    Delegation of Duties.

Each Lender and the Issuing Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the Issuing Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.10.8    No Other Duties, etc.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Lenders listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Lender hereunder.10.9    Administrative Agent’s Fee.

On January&#160;13, 2015, the Company was notified about the issuance of assessments totaling </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">14.4 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> Brazilian Real (&#8220;BRL&#8221;), or approximately </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$3.6 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, plus interest and penalties, for the period January 2010 through May 2011. The Company has disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to the claims. On February&#160;25, 2015, the Company received additional assessments totaling </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">33.3 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> BRL, or approximately </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$8.2 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, plus interest and penalties, related to the remainder of the audit period. The Company has also disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to these claims in administrative appeals. On August 29, 2017, the Company received a favorable ruling on its appeal of the first assessment, which dismissed all fines, penalties, and interest. The tax authorities have requested a special appeal to that decision. If the appeal is accepted, Crocs will have the opportunity to both defend the appeal as well as challenge it procedurally. Should the Brazilian Tax Authority prevail in this final administrative appeal, Crocs may still challenge the assessments through the court system, which would likely require the posting of a bond. Additionally, the second appeal for the remaining assessments was heard on March 22, 2018. That decision was partially favorable and resulted in an approximately </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">38%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> reduction in principal, penalties, and interest, leaving approximately </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$5.1 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, plus interest and penalties, at risk for those assessments. The tax authorities have appealed that decision. Crocs intends to file a response to the tax authorities&#8217; appeal as well as a separate appeal against the unfavorable portion of the ruling. We have not recorded these items within the condensed consolidated financial statements as it is not possible at this time to predict the timing or outcome of this matter or to estimate a potential amount of loss, if any.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">For all other claims and disputes, where the Company is able to estimate reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses, the Company estimates that as of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">September&#160;30, 2018</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, reasonably possible losses associated with these claims and other disputes are immaterial.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Although the Company is subject to other litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including employment, intellectual property and product liability claims, the Company is not party to any other pending legal proceedings that it believes would reasonably have a material adverse impact on its business, financial results, and cash flows.</font></div></div> <div style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;"><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Seasonality of Business</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Due to the seasonal nature of our footwear, which is more heavily focused on styles suitable for warm weather, revenues generated during our fourth quarter are typically less than revenues generated during our first three quarters, when the northern hemisphere is experiencing warmer weather.

style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the decrease in the effective tax rate, compared to the same period in 2017, is due to the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, partially offset by operating losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits, tax expense recorded in profitable jurisdictions, and the impact of the GILTI provisions included in the Tax Act. The Company evaluates the need for valuation allowances by analyzing all available positive and negative evidence.&#160;The Company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits in certain jurisdictions and the valuation allowances in these jurisdictions have been released. In other jurisdictions, the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits and has maintained or recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions. The Company has elected to account for GILTI as a period cost, and therefore has included GILTI expense in the effective tax rate calculation. The Company&#8217;s effective income tax rate, for each period presented, also differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate due to the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions and differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$4.6 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$6.2 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and the Company does not expect any significant changes in tax benefits in the next twelve months.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company&#8217;s tax rate fluctuates and may increase or decrease with changes in, among other things, the amount of income or loss by jurisdiction, the Company&#8217;s ability to utilize net operating losses and foreign tax credits, changes in tax laws, and the movement of liabilities established pursuant to accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions as statutes of limitations expire, positions are effectively settled, or when additional information becomes available. There are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions and other changes to regulatory environments in countries in which we do business that, if enacted, may have an impact on the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Additionally, the Company continues to evaluate the impacts of the&#160;Tax Act. As the Company further understands its implications, as well as the related, and yet to be issued, regulations and interpretations, the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate could be impacted. The Company is still evaluating the GILTI provisions of the&#160;Tax Act and the related implications and has concluded that the Company will record as a periodic expense as incurred, and, therefore, has not recorded deferred taxes for GILTI. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, the Company made adjustments to the amounts recorded as of&#160;December&#160;31, 2017, as a result of the Tax Act related to U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. As of December 31, 2017, the Company recorded provisional amounts based on estimates of the effects of the Tax Act as the analysis requires significant data from its foreign subsidiaries that is not regularly collected or analyzed. The U.S. federal transition tax liability, net of newly generated income tax credits, was an obligation of&#160;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$17.1 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">. Upon gathering additional information, the Company determined this liability to be </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$19.5 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">. The Company has existing foreign tax credits and other attributes which fully offset this transition tax obligation. However, the Company continues to consider these amounts provisional for the reasons discussed above. Additional impacts from the&#160;Tax Act will be recorded as they are identified during the measurement period pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"). The Company&#8217;s determination of the tax effects of the&#160;Tax Act will be completed no later than one year from the enactment date as permitted under SAB 118. Any further adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period will be finalized as part of our fourth quarter income tax procedures and recorded as part of the December 31, 2018 provision.</font></div></div> <div style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;"><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Transactions with Affiliates</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company receives services from three subsidiaries of Blackstone Capital Partners VI L.P.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company completed implementation of a new inventory costing system for approximately </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">95%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> of its inventories. In connection with the implementation, the Company changed its method of inventory costing from a moving average cost method to a first-in-first-out method. The Company believes this change in accounting principle is preferable because it results in more precision and consistency in global and regional inventory costs, more efficient analysis and better matching of inventory costs with revenues, better matches the physical flow of inventories, and improves comparability with industry peers. The change from the Company&#8217;s former inventory cost method did not have a material effect on inventory or cost of sales, and, as a result, prior comparative financial statements have not been restated.</font></div></div> <div style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">New Accounting Pronouncement Adopted</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In March 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued authoritative guidance on the income tax accounting implications of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act (&#8220;Tax Act&#8221;), addressing the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. The guidance provides a measurement period for companies to evaluate the impacts of the Tax Act on their financial statements. This measurement period begins in the reporting period that includes the enactment date and ends when an entity has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information that was needed in order to complete the accounting requirements, and cannot exceed one year. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the three and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">nine</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> months ended </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">September&#160;30, 2018</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and the year ended December 31, 2017, including provisional estimates for the Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax (&#8220;BEAT&#8221;), Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;), and transition tax. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;), and other standard-setting bodies may issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As we collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts that could materially affect our financial position and results of operations as well as our effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made.

This guidance may be adopted retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the income tax effects of the Tax Act related to items remaining in AOCI are recognized, or at the beginning of the period of adoption. The guidance becomes effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted.

Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, measured on a discounted basis, at the commencement date for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. Additionally, this guidance will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases, including qualitative and quantitative requirements. The guidance will be applied under a modified retrospective transition approach. The guidance and related amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In July 2017, the Company established an implementation team and engaged external advisers and solution providers to develop a multi-phase plan to assess the Company&#8217;s leasing arrangements, as well as any changes to accounting policies, processes, or necessary systems. The Company has procured the necessary software and services to facilitate adoption of the guidance. The Company is continuing its detailed review of its leases and other contractual arrangements, assessments of its systems and related accounting procedures and controls requirements. The Company has begun implementation of the software selected. The Company has elected all of the available transition practical expedients, including the &#8216;package of practical expedients&#8217;, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs, has elected not to apply &#8216;hindsight&#8217; when adopting the standard, and has elected the short-term lease exemption. Further, the Company has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of its leases. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s leases are operating leases under the new standard. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:11pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2019, which will also be the effective date for implementation of the standard. Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019. We expect that this standard will have a material effect on our financial statements. While we continue to assess all of the effects of the new standard, upon adoption we expect adoption to result in recognition of significant new lease-related assets and lease liabilities in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet, and significant new disclosures in the footnotes to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:11pt;"> The Company does not expect that adoption of the standard will have a significant effect on the consolidated operating income or the cash flows of the Company.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Other Pronouncements</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after&#160;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">September&#160;30, 2018</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;are not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s condensed consolidated financial statements.</font></div></div> <div style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;"><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;"></font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Unless otherwise noted in this report, any description of the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Crocs,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; includes Crocs,&#160;Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries within our reportable operating segments and corporate operations.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company completed implementation of a new inventory costing system for approximately </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">95%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> of its inventories. In connection with the implementation, the Company changed its method of inventory costing from a moving average cost method to a first-in-first-out method. The Company believes this change in accounting principle is preferable because it results in more precision and consistency in global and regional inventory costs, more efficient analysis and better matching of inventory costs with revenues, better matches the physical flow of inventories, and improves comparability with industry peers. The change from the Company&#8217;s former inventory cost method did not have a material effect on inventory or cost of sales, and, as a result, prior comparative financial statements have not been restated.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">As of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">September&#160;30, 2018</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">December&#160;31, 2017</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, our finished goods inventories accounted for </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">99.3%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">97.5%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, respectively, of our consolidated inventories, and the remaining balance consisted of raw materials and work-in-process.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Marketing Expenses</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Total marketing expenses inclusive of advertising, production, promotion, and agency expenses were </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$14.5 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$9.9 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> for the </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">three months ended September 30, 2018</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">2017</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, respectively, and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$55.4 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$49.6 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> for the </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">nine months ended September 30, 2018</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">2017</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, respectively.

In certain cases, control of the product transfers and revenues are recognized when the customer receives the product at the designated delivery point. For certain customers, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, cash payment from customers is required in advance of delivery and revenues are recognized upon the later of cash receipt or delivery of the product. For a small number of customers in the Asia Pacific region, products are sold on consignment and revenues are recognized on a sell-through basis. Wholesale customers are invoiced when products are shipped or delivered.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company has arrangements that grant certain wholesale customers exclusive licenses, concurrent with the terms of the related distribution agreements, to use the Company&#8217;s intellectual property in exchange for a sales-based royalty.

The guidance provides a measurement period for companies to evaluate the impacts of the Tax Act on their financial statements. This measurement period begins in the reporting period that includes the enactment date and ends when an entity has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information that was needed in order to complete the accounting requirements, and cannot exceed one year. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the three and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">nine</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> months ended </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">September&#160;30, 2018</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and the year ended December 31, 2017, including provisional estimates for the Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax (&#8220;BEAT&#8221;), Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;), and transition tax. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;), and other standard-setting bodies may issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As we collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts that could materially affect our financial position and results of operations as well as our effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made.

This guidance may be adopted retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the income tax effects of the Tax Act related to items remaining in AOCI are recognized, or at the beginning of the period of adoption. The guidance becomes effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s condensed consolidated financial statements.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Leases</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, measured on a discounted basis, at the commencement date for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. Additionally, this guidance will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases, including qualitative and quantitative requirements. The guidance will be applied under a modified retrospective transition approach. The guidance and related amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"/></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In July 2017, the Company established an implementation team and engaged external advisers and solution providers to develop a multi-phase plan to assess the Company&#8217;s leasing arrangements, as well as any changes to accounting policies, processes, or necessary systems. The Company has procured the necessary software and services to facilitate adoption of the guidance. The Company is continuing its detailed review of its leases and other contractual arrangements, assessments of its systems and related accounting procedures and controls requirements. The Company has begun implementation of the software selected. The Company has elected all of the available transition practical expedients, including the &#8216;package of practical expedients&#8217;, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs, has elected not to apply &#8216;hindsight&#8217; when adopting the standard, and has elected the short-term lease exemption. Further, the Company has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of its leases. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s leases are operating leases under the new standard. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:11pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2019, which will also be the effective date for implementation of the standard.

The Company is engaged in the design, development, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children. We strive to be the global leader in the sale of molded footwear characterized by functionality, comfort, color, and lightweight design. Our reportable operating segments include: the Americas, operating in North and South America; Asia Pacific, operating throughout Asia, Australia, and New Zealand; and Europe, operating throughout Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Russia, Africa, and the Middle East. In the third quarter of 2018, certain revenues and expenses previously reported within the ‘Asia Pacific’ segment were shifted to the ‘Europe’ segment. See Note 13 — Operating Segments and Geographic Information for additional information. The previously reported amounts for revenues and income from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and reflect all adjustments which are necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Such unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (“Annual Report”), and have been prepared on a consistent basis with the accounting policies described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report. Our accounting policies did not change during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, other than for the change in accounting principle described in “Inventories” below and the new accounting pronouncements adopted as described in Note 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements.Seasonality of BusinessDue to the seasonal nature of our footwear, which is more heavily focused on styles suitable for warm weather, revenues generated during our fourth quarter are typically less than revenues generated during our first three quarters, when the northern hemisphere is experiencing warmer weather. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including the timing of new model introductions, general economic conditions, and consumer confidence. Accordingly, results of operations and cash flows for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of expected results for any other quarter or for any other year.Transactions with AffiliatesThe Company receives services from three subsidiaries of Blackstone Capital Partners VI L.P. (“Blackstone”). Blackstone and certain of its permitted transferees currently beneficially own all the outstanding shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”), which is convertible into approximately 13.8 million shares, or 17.0%, of the Company’s common stock as of September 30, 2018. Blackstone also has the right to nominate two representatives to serve on the Company’s Board of Directors.Certain Blackstone subsidiaries provide various services to the Company, including inventory count services, cybersecurity and consulting, and workforce management services. The Company paid $0.1 million for each of the three month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $0.5 million and $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for these services. Expenses related to these services are reported in ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.Restricted CashRestricted cash primarily consists of funds to secure certain retail store leases, certain customs requirements, and other contractual arrangements.InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company completed implementation of a new inventory costing system for approximately 95% of its inventories. In connection with the implementation, the Company changed its method of inventory costing from a moving average cost method to a first-in-first-out method. The Company believes this change in accounting principle is preferable because it results in more precision and consistency in global and regional inventory costs, more efficient analysis and better matching of inventory costs with revenues, better matches the physical flow of inventories, and improves comparability with industry peers. The change from the Company’s former inventory cost method did not have a material effect on inventory or cost of sales, and, as a result, prior comparative financial statements have not been restated.As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our finished goods inventories accounted for 99.3% and 97.5%, respectively, of our consolidated inventories, and the remaining balance consisted of raw materials and work-in-process.Marketing ExpensesTotal marketing expenses inclusive of advertising, production, promotion, and agency expenses were $14.5 million and $9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $55.4 million and $49.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Marketing expenses are reported in ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.Prepaid advertising and promotional endorsement expenses of $9.3 million and $7.0 million are included in ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

The guidance provides a measurement period for companies to evaluate the impacts of the Tax Act on their financial statements. This measurement period begins in the reporting period that includes the enactment date and ends when an entity has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information that was needed in order to complete the accounting requirements, and cannot exceed one year. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017, including provisional estimates for the Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax (“BEAT”), Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”), and transition tax. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), and other standard-setting bodies may issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As we collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts that could materially affect our financial position and results of operations as well as our effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. See Note 10 — Income Taxes for more information.Stock Compensation Scope of Modification AccountingIn May 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to clarify those changes to terms and conditions of stock-based compensation awards that are required to be accounted for as modifications of existing stock-based awards. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2018. The adoption did not have an impact on our condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations. Clarifying the Definition of a BusinessIn January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to clarify the definition of a business, for purposes of determining whether a business has been acquired or sold, and consequently whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of a business or as acquisitions or disposals of assets. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2018. The adoption did not have an impact on our condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations. Statements of Cash Flows - Classification and Change in Restricted CashIn August 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statements of cash flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance requiring that restricted cash be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period amounts reported in the statements of cash flows. The guidance is applied retrospectively to all periods presented and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2018. As a result of the adoption, the Company changed the presentation in its statements of cash flows for all periods presented.Prepaid Stored-Value ProductsIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to the recognition of breakage for certain prepaid stored-value products. The standard is effective for annual periods (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Revenue RecognitionIn May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to revenue recognition from contracts with customers. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the guidance using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements was not restated and is reported under the accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. The adoption of this guidance did not have, and is not expected to have, a significant impact on our reported revenues, gross margins or income from operations.Substantially all of the Company’s revenues are recognized when control of product passes to customers when the products are shipped or delivered. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company changed its balance sheet presentation for expected product returns by reporting a product return asset for the right to receive returned products and a returns liability for amounts expected to be refunded to customers as a result of product returns. The product return asset is reported within ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The returns liability and payments received from customers for future delivery of products are reported within ‘Accrued liabilities and other expenses’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.The Company elected to account for shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control of product passes to customers as fulfillment costs, which are expensed as incurred and included in ‘Cost of sales’ in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. There is no change to the Company’s comparative reporting of shipping and handling costs as a result of adoption. The Company elected to expense incremental costs to obtain customer contracts, consisting primarily of commission incentives, when incurred and reports these costs within ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in its condensed consolidated statements of operations. There is no change to the Company’s comparative reporting of incremental costs to obtain customer contracts as a result of adoption.The impact of adoption on the January 1, 2018 condensed consolidated balance sheet was:  December 31, 2017 Impact of Adoption (1) January 1, 2018  (in thousands)Assets:      Accounts receivable, net  $83,518 $1,801 $85,319  Prepaid expenses and other assets 22,596 1,555 24,151       Liabilities:      Accrued expenses and other liabilities 84,446 3,356 87,802(1) Prior to adoption, product return assets and return liabilities were reported within ‘Accounts receivable, net’, within the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of the adoption date, the product return assets were reclassified and reported as a component of ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’, and return liabilities were reclassified to ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet.The impact of the new revenue recognition guidance on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2018 was:  September 30, 2018  Balances Without Adoption Effects of New Guidance (1) As Reported  (in thousands)Assets:      Accounts receivable, net  $106,091 $4,387 $110,478Prepaid expenses and other assets 22,982 2,874 25,856       Liabilities:      Accrued expenses and other liabilities 92,532 7,261 99,793(1) The new revenue recognition guidance requires comparative disclosures of the effects of the new guidance on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements for all interim periods during the year of adoption. The new guidance did not have a significant effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018.See Note 8 — Revenues for additional disclosures.New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedReclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeIn February 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that permits reclassification of the income tax effects of the Tax Act on accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to retained earnings. This guidance may be adopted retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the income tax effects of the Tax Act related to items remaining in AOCI are recognized, or at the beginning of the period of adoption. The guidance becomes effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, measured on a discounted basis, at the commencement date for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. Additionally, this guidance will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases, including qualitative and quantitative requirements. The guidance will be applied under a modified retrospective transition approach. The guidance and related amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted.In July 2017, the Company established an implementation team and engaged external advisers and solution providers to develop a multi-phase plan to assess the Company’s leasing arrangements, as well as any changes to accounting policies, processes, or necessary systems. The Company has procured the necessary software and services to facilitate adoption of the guidance. The Company is continuing its detailed review of its leases and other contractual arrangements, assessments of its systems and related accounting procedures and controls requirements. The Company has begun implementation of the software selected. The Company has elected all of the available transition practical expedients, including the ‘package of practical expedients’, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs, has elected not to apply ‘hindsight’ when adopting the standard, and has elected the short-term lease exemption. Further, the Company has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of its leases. Substantially all of the Company’s leases are operating leases under the new standard. The Company will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2019, which will also be the effective date for implementation of the standard. Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019. We expect that this standard will have a material effect on our financial statements. While we continue to assess all of the effects of the new standard, upon adoption we expect adoption to result in recognition of significant new lease-related assets and lease liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, and significant new disclosures in the footnotes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect that adoption of the standard will have a significant effect on the consolidated operating income or the cash flows of the Company.Other PronouncementsOther new pronouncements issued but not effective until after September 30, 2018 are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

In order to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency and to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company enters into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currency. By policy, the Company does not enter into these contracts for trading purposes or speculation. Counterparty default risk is considered low because the forward contracts that the Company enters into are over-the-counter instruments transacted with highly-rated financial institutions. The Company was not required to and did not post collateral as of September 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017.The Company’s derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company reports derivative instruments with the same counterparty on a net basis when a master netting arrangement is in place. Changes in fair value are recognized within ‘Foreign currency gains (losses), net’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company classifies cash flows from derivative instruments at settlement in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items within ‘Cash provided by operating activities.’Results of Derivative ActivitiesThe fair values of derivative assets and liabilities, net, all of which are classified as Level 2 and are reported within either ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’ or ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, were: September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Derivative Assets Derivative Liabilities Derivative Assets Derivative Liabilities (in thousands)Forward foreign currency exchange contracts$1,581 $(987) $1,241 $(1,647)Netting of counterparty contracts(987) 987 (1,241) 1,241  Foreign currency forward contract derivatives$594 $— $— $(406)The notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts presented below report the total U.S. Dollar equivalent position and the net contract fair values for each foreign currency position. September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Notional Fair Value Notional Fair Value (in thousands)Singapore Dollar$36,985 $(102) $73,455 $364Euro48,865 (90) 37,718 (122)Japanese Yen40,510 171 30,688 (89)South Korean Won30,974 (29) 15,888 (134)British Pound Sterling50,406 12 13,233 80Other currencies62,452 632 53,698 (505)Total$270,192 $594 $224,680 $(406)        Latest maturity dateOctober 2018 January 2018Amounts reported in ‘Foreign currency gains (losses), net’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations include both realized and unrealized gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions and derivative contracts, and were: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in thousands)Foreign currency transaction gains (losses)$(1,382) $(674) $(894) $1,120Foreign currency forward exchange contracts gains (losses)1,615 417 2,481 (939)Foreign currency gains (losses), net$233 $(257) $1,587 $181 X - ReferencesNo definition available. + Details Name: us-gaap_DerivativeInstrumentsAndHedgingActivitiesDisclosureAbstract Namespace Prefix: us-gaap_ Data Type: xbrli:stringItemType Balance Type: na Period Type: duration X - DefinitionThe entire disclosure for derivative instruments and hedging activities including, but not limited to, risk management strategies, non-hedging derivative instruments, assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and methodologies and assumptions used in determining the amounts. + ReferencesReference 1: http://fasb.org/us-gaap/role/ref/legacyRef -Publisher FASB -Name Accounting Standards Codification -Topic 815 -URI http://asc.fasb.org/topic&trid=2229140 + Details Name: us-gaap_DerivativeInstrumentsAndHedgingActivitiesDisclosureTextBlock Namespace Prefix: us-gaap_ Data Type: nonnum:textBlockItemType Balance Type: na Period Type: duration XML 23 R12.htm IDEA: XBRL DOCUMENT /* Do Not Remove This Comment */ function toggleNextSibling (e) { if (e.nextSibling.style.display=='none') { e.nextSibling.style.display='block'; } else { e.nextSibling.style.display='none'; } } v3.10.0.1 Revolving Credit Facility and Bank Borrowings 9 Months Ended Sep. 30, 2018 Debt Disclosure [Abstract]   Revolving Credit Facility and Bank Borrowings REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES AND BANK BORROWINGS  The Company’s borrowings consisted of: September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 (in thousands)Notes payable$— $662Capital lease obligations26 44Total borrowings and capital lease obligations26 706Less: Current portion of borrowings and capital lease obligations11 676Total long-term capital lease obligations$15 $30Senior Revolving Credit FacilityIn December 2011, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility (the “Facility”), pursuant to an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), with the lenders named therein and PNC Bank, National Association, as a lender and administrative agent for the lenders. The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict certain actions by the Company, including limitations on: (i) stock repurchases to an aggregate of $100.0 million per fiscal year, subject to certain restrictions; and (ii) capital expenditures and commitments to $50.0 million per year. The Credit Agreement also permits intercompany loans of up to $375.0 million and requires the Company to meet certain financial covenant ratios that become effective when average outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, including letters of credit, exceed the lesser of $40.0 million or 40% of the total commitments during certain periods or if the outstanding borrowings exceed the borrowing base. If the financial covenant ratios are in effect, the Company must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.As of September 30, 2018, the total commitments available from the lenders under the Facility were $100.0 million. At September 30, 2018, the Company had no outstanding borrowings and $0.6 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Facility, which reduces amounts available for borrowing under the Facility. As of both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had $99.4 million, respectively, of available borrowing capacity under the Facility. The Facility matures in February 2021.On November 5, 2018, the Company entered into the Sixteenth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which, among other things: (i) increased the total commitments under the Credit Agreement to $150.0 million from $100.0 million; (ii) increased permitted stock repurchases to $200.0 million from $100.0 million per year; (iii) increased total permitted stock repurchases to $800.0 million from $600.0 million cumulatively; and (iv) added an additional lender under the Credit Agreement.Asia Revolving Credit Facilities The Company’s revolving credit facility agreement with HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch (“HSBC”), or the “HSBC Facility,” provides the Company uncommitted dual currency revolving loan facilities of up to 40.0 million Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”), or $5.8 million, with a combined facility limit of RMB 60.0 million, or $8.7 million. The HSBC Facility may be canceled at any time by either party. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding and borrowings under the HSBC Facility remained suspended at the discretion of HSBC.The Company’s one year revolving credit facility agreement with China Merchants Bank Company Limited, Shanghai Branch (the “CMBC Facility”), provides the Company a revolving loan facility of up to 30.0 million RMB, or $4.4 million, subject to consent by the lender. The CMBC Facility matures in January 2019. The CMBC Facility may be canceled or suspended at any time by either party.

The comparative information presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements was not restated and is reported under the accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. See ‘Revenue Recognition’ in Note 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements for a discussion of the significant changes resulting from adoption of the guidance. The adoption of the guidance did not have a significant impact on revenues.Revenues by reportable operating segment and by channel were:  Three Months Ended September 30, 2018  Americas Asia Pacific Europe Other Businesses Total  (in thousands)Wholesale (1) $44,883 $40,938 $29,373 $1,525 $116,719Retail 65,247 22,942 10,345 — 98,534E-commerce 26,827 11,283 7,701 — 45,811Total revenues $136,957 $75,163 $47,419 $1,525 $261,064  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018  Americas Asia Pacific Europe Other Businesses Total  (in thousands)Wholesale (1) $171,477 $172,152 $130,150 $2,133 $475,912Retail 156,557 71,359 29,601 — 257,517E-commerce 70,515 45,134 23,138 — 138,787Total revenues $398,549 $288,645 $182,889 $2,133 $872,216(1) In the third quarter of 2018, certain revenues previously reported within the ‘Asia Pacific’ segment were shifted to the ‘Europe’ segment.Revenues are recognized in the amount expected to be received in exchange for goods when control of the products transfers to customers, and excludes various forms of promotions, which range from contractually-fixed percentage price reductions to sales returns, discounts, rebates, and other incentives that may vary in amount and must be estimated. Variable amounts are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and adjusted as better estimates become available. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company recognized increases of $0.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, to wholesale revenues due to changes in estimates related to products transferred to customers in prior periods. There were no changes to estimates in retail and e-commerce channels during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018.The Company elected to exclude from revenues taxes assessed by governmental authorities, including value-added and other sales-related taxes, that are imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing activities, and, as a result, there is no change in presentation from prior comparative periods.The following is a description of our principal revenue-generating activities by distribution channel. The Company has three reportable operating segments and sells its products using three primary distribution channels. For more detailed information about reportable operating segments, see ‘Note 13 — Operating Segments and Geographic Information’. Wholesale ChannelFor the majority of wholesale customers, control transfers and revenues are recognized when the product is shipped or delivered from a manufacturing facility or distribution center to the wholesale customer. In certain cases, control of the product transfers and revenues are recognized when the customer receives the product at the designated delivery point. For certain customers, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, cash payment from customers is required in advance of delivery and revenues are recognized upon the later of cash receipt or delivery of the product. For a small number of customers in the Asia Pacific region, products are sold on consignment and revenues are recognized on a sell-through basis. Wholesale customers are invoiced when products are shipped or delivered.The Company has arrangements that grant certain wholesale customers exclusive licenses, concurrent with the terms of the related distribution agreements, to use the Company’s intellectual property in exchange for a sales-based royalty. Sales-based royalty revenues are recognized over the terms of the related license agreements as sales are made by the wholesalers.Retail ChannelThe Company transfers control of products and recognizes revenues at retail stores at the point of sale, in exchange for cash or other payment, primarily debit or credit card. A portion of the transaction price charged to our customers is variable, primarily due to promotional discounts or allowances, and terms that permit retail customers to exchange or return products for a full refund within a limited period of time. When recognizing revenues, the amount of revenues associated with expected sales returns is estimated based on historical experience, and adjustments to our estimates are made when the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive changes. E-commerce ChannelIn the e-commerce channel, the Company transfers control and recognizes revenues when the product is shipped from the distribution centers. Payment from customers is primarily through debit and credit card and is made at the time the customer order is shipped.Similar to the retail channel, a portion of the amount of revenue is variable, primarily due to sales returns, discounts, and other promotional allowances offered to our customers. When recognizing revenues, the amount of revenues associated with expected sales returns is estimated based on historical experience, and adjustments are made when the most likely amount of consideration changes. Historically, the amount of revenues associated with product returns in the e-commerce channel has been higher than the retail channel.Contract LiabilitiesContract liabilities consist of advance cash deposits received from wholesale customers to secure product orders in connection with seasonal selling seasons, and payments received in advance of delivery. As products are shipped and control transfers, the Company recognizes the deferred revenue in ‘Revenues’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. At January 1 and September 30, 2018, $1.3 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of deferred revenues associated with advance customer deposits were reported in ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenues of $0.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively, were recognized in revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018. The remainder of deferred revenues at September 30, 2018 are expected to be recognized in revenues during the fourth quarter of 2018 as products are shipped or delivered.Refund LiabilitiesRefund liabilities, primarily associated with product sales returns, retrospective volume rebates, and early payment discounts are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience, and adjustments to revenues made when the most likely amount of consideration expected changes. At January 1 and September 30, 2018, $3.4 million and $7.3 million, respectively, of refund liabilities, primarily associated with product returns, were reported in ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

The Company evaluates the need for valuation allowances by analyzing all available positive and negative evidence. The Company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits in certain jurisdictions and the valuation allowances in these jurisdictions have been released. In other jurisdictions, the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits and has maintained or recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions. The Company has elected to account for GILTI as a period cost, and therefore has included GILTI expense in the effective tax rate calculation. The Company’s effective income tax rate, for each period presented, also differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate due to the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions and differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $4.6 million and $6.2 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and the Company does not expect any significant changes in tax benefits in the next twelve months.The Company’s tax rate fluctuates and may increase or decrease with changes in, among other things, the amount of income or loss by jurisdiction, the Company’s ability to utilize net operating losses and foreign tax credits, changes in tax laws, and the movement of liabilities established pursuant to accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions as statutes of limitations expire, positions are effectively settled, or when additional information becomes available. There are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions and other changes to regulatory environments in countries in which we do business that, if enacted, may have an impact on the Company’s effective tax rate.Additionally, the Company continues to evaluate the impacts of the Tax Act. As the Company further understands its implications, as well as the related, and yet to be issued, regulations and interpretations, the Company’s effective tax rate could be impacted. The Company is still evaluating the GILTI provisions of the Tax Act and the related implications and has concluded that the Company will record as a periodic expense as incurred, and, therefore, has not recorded deferred taxes for GILTI. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, the Company made adjustments to the amounts recorded as of December 31, 2017, as a result of the Tax Act related to U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. As of December 31, 2017, the Company recorded provisional amounts based on estimates of the effects of the Tax Act as the analysis requires significant data from its foreign subsidiaries that is not regularly collected or analyzed. The U.S. federal transition tax liability, net of newly generated income tax credits, was an obligation of $17.1 million. Upon gathering additional information, the Company determined this liability to be $19.5 million. The Company has existing foreign tax credits and other attributes which fully offset this transition tax obligation. However, the Company continues to consider these amounts provisional for the reasons discussed above. Additional impacts from the Tax Act will be recorded as they are identified during the measurement period pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"). The Company’s determination of the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed no later than one year from the enactment date as permitted under SAB 118. Any further adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period will be finalized as part of our fourth quarter income tax procedures and recorded as part of the December 31, 2018 provision.

In addition, the ‘Other businesses’ category aggregates insignificant operating segments that do not meet the reportable segment threshold, including company-operated manufacturing operations and corporate operations.Each of the reportable operating segments derives its revenues from the sale of footwear and accessories to external customers. Revenues for ‘Other businesses’ include non-footwear product sales to external customers that are excluded from the measurement of segment operating revenues and income. Segment performance is evaluated based on segment results without allocating corporate expenses, or indirect general, administrative, and other expenses. Segment profits or losses include adjustments to eliminate inter-segment sales. Reconciling items between segment income from operations and income from operations consist of other businesses and unallocated corporate and other expenses, as well as inter-segment eliminations. The following tables set forth information related to reportable operating segments: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in thousands)Revenues:       Americas$136,957 $120,459 $398,549 $374,336Asia Pacific (1)75,163 75,320 288,645 278,656Europe (1)47,419 47,240 182,889 170,864Total segment revenues259,539 243,019 870,083 823,856Other businesses1,525 254 2,133 545Total consolidated revenues$261,064 $243,273 $872,216 $824,401Income from operations: (2)       Americas$42,586 $24,398 $110,814 $81,132Asia Pacific (1)16,861 14,115 74,640 70,880Europe (1)12,064 4,870 53,819 35,182Total segment income from operations71,511 43,383 239,273 187,194Reconciliation of total segment income from operations to income before income taxes:       Other businesses (3)(14,092) (6,233) (41,557) (16,883)Unallocated corporate and other (2)(43,524) (34,465) (120,835) (122,598)Income from operations13,895 2,685 76,881 47,713Foreign currency gains, net233 (257) 1,587 181Interest income422 269 847 576Interest expense(126) (167) (371) (539)Other income160 54 229 187Income before income taxes$14,584 $2,584 $79,173 $48,118Depreciation and amortization:       Americas$1,098 $1,383 $3,613 $4,075Asia Pacific422 863 1,655 2,710Europe301 374 980 1,138Total segment depreciation and amortization1,821 2,620 6,248 7,923Other businesses1,213 1,618 4,168 5,106Unallocated corporate and other3,627 3,648 11,119 11,672Total consolidated depreciation and amortization$6,661 $7,886 $21,535 $24,701(1) In the third quarter of 2018, certain revenues and expenses previously reported within the ‘Asia Pacific’ segment were shifted to the ‘Europe’ segment.The previously reported amounts for revenues and income from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 have also been revised to conform to the current period presentation.

On January 13, 2015, the Company was notified about the issuance of assessments totaling 14.4 million Brazilian Real (“BRL”), or approximately $3.6 million, plus interest and penalties, for the period January 2010 through May 2011. The Company has disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to the claims. On February 25, 2015, the Company received additional assessments totaling 33.3 million BRL, or approximately $8.2 million, plus interest and penalties, related to the remainder of the audit period. The Company has also disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to these claims in administrative appeals. On August 29, 2017, the Company received a favorable ruling on its appeal of the first assessment, which dismissed all fines, penalties, and interest. The tax authorities have requested a special appeal to that decision. If the appeal is accepted, Crocs will have the opportunity to both defend the appeal as well as challenge it procedurally. Should the Brazilian Tax Authority prevail in this final administrative appeal, Crocs may still challenge the assessments through the court system, which would likely require the posting of a bond. Additionally, the second appeal for the remaining assessments was heard on March 22, 2018. That decision was partially favorable and resulted in an approximately 38% reduction in principal, penalties, and interest, leaving approximately $5.1 million, plus interest and penalties, at risk for those assessments. The tax authorities have appealed that decision. Crocs intends to file a response to the tax authorities’ appeal as well as a separate appeal against the unfavorable portion of the ruling. We have not recorded these items within the condensed consolidated financial statements as it is not possible at this time to predict the timing or outcome of this matter or to estimate a potential amount of loss, if any.For all other claims and disputes, where the Company is able to estimate reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses, the Company estimates that as of September 30, 2018, reasonably possible losses associated with these claims and other disputes are immaterial.Although the Company is subject to other litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including employment, intellectual property and product liability claims, the Company is not party to any other pending legal proceedings that it believes would reasonably have a material adverse impact on its business, financial results, and cash flows.

The Company is engaged in the design, development, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children. We strive to be the global leader in the sale of molded footwear characterized by functionality, comfort, color, and lightweight design. Segment Reporting Our reportable operating segments include: the Americas, operating in North and South America; Asia Pacific, operating throughout Asia, Australia, and New Zealand; and Europe, operating throughout Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Russia, Africa, and the Middle East. In the third quarter of 2018, certain revenues and expenses previously reported within the ‘Asia Pacific’ segment were shifted to the ‘Europe’ segment. See Note 13 — Operating Segments and Geographic Information for additional information. The previously reported amounts for revenues and income from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 have been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and reflect all adjustments which are necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Such unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (“Annual Report”), and have been prepared on a consistent basis with the accounting policies described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report. Seasonality of Business Seasonality of BusinessDue to the seasonal nature of our footwear, which is more heavily focused on styles suitable for warm weather, revenues generated during our fourth quarter are typically less than revenues generated during our first three quarters, when the northern hemisphere is experiencing warmer weather. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including the timing of new model introductions, general economic conditions, and consumer confidence. Accordingly, results of operations and cash flows for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of expected results for any other quarter or for any other year. Transactions with Affiliates Transactions with AffiliatesThe Company receives services from three subsidiaries of Blackstone Capital Partners VI L.P. (“Blackstone”). Blackstone and certain of its permitted transferees currently beneficially own all the outstanding shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”), which is convertible into approximately 13.8 million shares, or 17.0%, of the Company’s common stock as of September 30, 2018. Blackstone also has the right to nominate two representatives to serve on the Company’s Board of Directors.Certain Blackstone subsidiaries provide various services to the Company, including inventory count services, cybersecurity and consulting, and workforce management services. The Company paid $0.1 million for each of the three month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $0.5 million and $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for these services. Expenses related to these services are reported in ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Restricted Cash Restricted CashRestricted cash primarily consists of funds to secure certain retail store leases, certain customs requirements, and other contractual arrangements. Inventories InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company completed implementation of a new inventory costing system for approximately 95% of its inventories. In connection with the implementation, the Company changed its method of inventory costing from a moving average cost method to a first-in-first-out method. The Company believes this change in accounting principle is preferable because it results in more precision and consistency in global and regional inventory costs, more efficient analysis and better matching of inventory costs with revenues, better matches the physical flow of inventories, and improves comparability with industry peers. The change from the Company’s former inventory cost method did not have a material effect on inventory or cost of sales, and, as a result, prior comparative financial statements have not been restated. Marketing Expense Marketing ExpensesTotal marketing expenses inclusive of advertising, production, promotion, and agency expenses were $14.5 million and $9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $55.4 million and $49.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Marketing expenses are reported in ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.Prepaid advertising and promotional endorsement expenses of $9.3 million and $7.0 million are included in ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements New Accounting Pronouncement AdoptedIncome Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs ActIn March 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued authoritative guidance on the income tax accounting implications of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act (“Tax Act”), addressing the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. The guidance provides a measurement period for companies to evaluate the impacts of the Tax Act on their financial statements. This measurement period begins in the reporting period that includes the enactment date and ends when an entity has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information that was needed in order to complete the accounting requirements, and cannot exceed one year. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017, including provisional estimates for the Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax (“BEAT”), Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”), and transition tax. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), and other standard-setting bodies may issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As we collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts that could materially affect our financial position and results of operations as well as our effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. See Note 10 — Income Taxes for more information.Stock Compensation Scope of Modification AccountingIn May 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to clarify those changes to terms and conditions of stock-based compensation awards that are required to be accounted for as modifications of existing stock-based awards. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2018. The adoption did not have an impact on our condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations. Clarifying the Definition of a BusinessIn January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to clarify the definition of a business, for purposes of determining whether a business has been acquired or sold, and consequently whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of a business or as acquisitions or disposals of assets. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2018. The adoption did not have an impact on our condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations. Statements of Cash Flows - Classification and Change in Restricted CashIn August 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statements of cash flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance requiring that restricted cash be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period amounts reported in the statements of cash flows. The guidance is applied retrospectively to all periods presented and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2018. As a result of the adoption, the Company changed the presentation in its statements of cash flows for all periods presented.Prepaid Stored-Value ProductsIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to the recognition of breakage for certain prepaid stored-value products. The standard is effective for annual periods (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Revenue RecognitionIn May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to revenue recognition from contracts with customers. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the guidance using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements was not restated and is reported under the accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. The adoption of this guidance did not have, and is not expected to have, a significant impact on our reported revenues, gross margins or income from operations.Substantially all of the Company’s revenues are recognized when control of product passes to customers when the products are shipped or delivered. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company changed its balance sheet presentation for expected product returns by reporting a product return asset for the right to receive returned products and a returns liability for amounts expected to be refunded to customers as a result of product returns. The product return asset is reported within ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The returns liability and payments received from customers for future delivery of products are reported within ‘Accrued liabilities and other expenses’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.The Company elected to account for shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control of product passes to customers as fulfillment costs, which are expensed as incurred and included in ‘Cost of sales’ in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. There is no change to the Company’s comparative reporting of shipping and handling costs as a result of adoption. The Company elected to expense incremental costs to obtain customer contracts, consisting primarily of commission incentives, when incurred and reports these costs within ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in its condensed consolidated statements of operations. There is no change to the Company’s comparative reporting of incremental costs to obtain customer contracts as a result of adoption.The impact of adoption on the January 1, 2018 condensed consolidated balance sheet was:  December 31, 2017 Impact of Adoption (1) January 1, 2018  (in thousands)Assets:      Accounts receivable, net  $83,518 $1,801 $85,319  Prepaid expenses and other assets 22,596 1,555 24,151       Liabilities:      Accrued expenses and other liabilities 84,446 3,356 87,802(1) Prior to adoption, product return assets and return liabilities were reported within ‘Accounts receivable, net’, within the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of the adoption date, the product return assets were reclassified and reported as a component of ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’, and return liabilities were reclassified to ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet.The impact of the new revenue recognition guidance on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2018 was:  September 30, 2018  Balances Without Adoption Effects of New Guidance (1) As Reported  (in thousands)Assets:      Accounts receivable, net  $106,091 $4,387 $110,478Prepaid expenses and other assets 22,982 2,874 25,856       Liabilities:      Accrued expenses and other liabilities 92,532 7,261 99,793(1) The new revenue recognition guidance requires comparative disclosures of the effects of the new guidance on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements for all interim periods during the year of adoption. The new guidance did not have a significant effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018.See Note 8 — Revenues for additional disclosures.New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedReclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeIn February 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that permits reclassification of the income tax effects of the Tax Act on accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to retained earnings. This guidance may be adopted retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the income tax effects of the Tax Act related to items remaining in AOCI are recognized, or at the beginning of the period of adoption. The guidance becomes effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, measured on a discounted basis, at the commencement date for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. Additionally, this guidance will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases, including qualitative and quantitative requirements. The guidance will be applied under a modified retrospective transition approach. The guidance and related amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted.In July 2017, the Company established an implementation team and engaged external advisers and solution providers to develop a multi-phase plan to assess the Company’s leasing arrangements, as well as any changes to accounting policies, processes, or necessary systems. The Company has procured the necessary software and services to facilitate adoption of the guidance. The Company is continuing its detailed review of its leases and other contractual arrangements, assessments of its systems and related accounting procedures and controls requirements. The Company has begun implementation of the software selected. The Company has elected all of the available transition practical expedients, including the ‘package of practical expedients’, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs, has elected not to apply ‘hindsight’ when adopting the standard, and has elected the short-term lease exemption. Further, the Company has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of its leases. Substantially all of the Company’s leases are operating leases under the new standard. The Company will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2019, which will also be the effective date for implementation of the standard. Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019. We expect that this standard will have a material effect on our financial statements. While we continue to assess all of the effects of the new standard, upon adoption we expect adoption to result in recognition of significant new lease-related assets and lease liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, and significant new disclosures in the footnotes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect that adoption of the standard will have a significant effect on the consolidated operating income or the cash flows of the Company.Other PronouncementsOther new pronouncements issued but not effective until after September 30, 2018 are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Derivatives Financial Instruments The Company’s derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company reports derivative instruments with the same counterparty on a net basis when a master netting arrangement is in place. Changes in fair value are recognized within ‘Foreign currency gains (losses), net’ in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company classifies cash flows from derivative instruments at settlement in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items within ‘Cash provided by operating activities. X - DefinitionDisclosure of accounting policy for advertising costs.

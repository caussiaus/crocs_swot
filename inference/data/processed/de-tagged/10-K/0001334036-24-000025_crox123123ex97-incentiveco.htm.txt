Unless otherwise defined in this Policy, capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth in Section 10 below.2.Policy for Recovery of Erroneously Awarded CompensationIn the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company will recover reasonably promptly the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received by an Executive Officer during the Recovery Period. 3.Administration3.a.This Policy shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Crocs, Inc. Board of Directors (the “Board”), except that the Board may determine to act as the administrator or designate another committee of the Board to act as the administrator with respect to any portion of this Policy other than Section 3.3 (the “Administrator”). The Administrator is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. 3.b.The Administrator is authorized to take appropriate steps to implement this Policy and may affect recovery hereunder by: (i) requiring payment to the Company, (ii) set-off, (iii) reducing compensation, or (iv) such other means or combination of means as the Administrator determines to be appropriate. 3.c.The Company need not recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation if and to the extent that the Compensation Committee determines that such recovery is impracticable and not required under Rule 10D-1 and the Listing Standards because: (i) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered after making a reasonable attempt to recover, (ii) recovery would violate home country law adopted prior to November 28, 2022, after obtaining the opinion of home country counsel acceptable to Nasdaq, or (iii) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified broad-based retirement plan to fail the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations thereunder. 3.d.Any determinations made by the Administrator under this Policy shall be final and binding on all affected individuals and need not be uniform with respect to each individual covered by this Policy. 4.Other Recovery Rights; Company Claims    - 1 -Any right of recovery pursuant to this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Company under applicable law or pursuant to the terms of any other compensation recovery policy of the Company that may be in effect from time to time, including in any employment agreement, plan or award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company. Nothing contained in this Policy and no recovery hereunder shall limit any claims, damages, or other legal remedies the Company may have against an individual arising out of or resulting from any actions or omissions by such individual.5.Reporting and DisclosureThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of federal securities laws. 6.Indemnification ProhibitionNotwithstanding the terms of any indemnification or insurance policy or any contractual arrangement that may be interpreted to the contrary, the Company shall not indemnify any individual with respect to amount(s) recovered under this Policy or claims relating to the enforcement of this Policy, including any payment or reimbursement for the cost of third-party insurance purchased by such individual to fund potential clawback obligations hereunder. 7.Amendment; TerminationThe Board or the Compensation Committee may amend or terminate this Policy from time to time in its discretion as it deems appropriate and shall amend this policy as it deems necessary to comply with applicable law or any rules or standards adopted by a national securities exchange or association on which the Company’s securities are listed; provided, however, that no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective to the extent it would cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, Securities and Exchange Commission rule or the rules or standards of any national securities exchange or association on which the Company’s securities are listed. 8.SuccessorsThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all individuals who are or were Executive Officers and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal representatives.9.Effective DateThis Policy is effective only for Incentive-Based Compensation Received by an Executive Officer on or after the Effective Date. 10.Definitions.

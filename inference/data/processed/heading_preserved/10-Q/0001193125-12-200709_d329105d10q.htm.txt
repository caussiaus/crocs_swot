**CROCS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES**
**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**(Unaudited)**
**1\. BASIS OF PRESENTATION**
Crocs, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, we, us, or the Company) are engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for reporting on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, these statements do not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP or SEC rules and regulations for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring matters) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.
These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the 2011 Form 10-K). The accounting policies used in preparing these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are the same as those described in Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements in the 2011 Form 10-K.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates, judgments and assumptions made when accounting for items and matters such as, but not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, sales returns and discounts, impairment assessments and charges, recoverability of assets (including deferred tax assets), uncertain tax positions, share-based compensation expense, the fair value of acquired intangibles, useful lives assigned to long-lived assets, depreciation and provisions for contingencies are reasonable based on information available at the time they are made. Management also makes estimates in the assessments of potential losses in relation to threatened or pending legal and tax matters. See Note 13  Legal Proceedings. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates. For matters not related to income taxes, if a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company recognizes an expense for the estimated loss. If there is the potential to recover a portion of the estimated loss from a third party, the Company makes a separate assessment of recoverability and reduces the estimated loss if recovery is also deemed probable.
**_Reclassifications_**  We reclassified the Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses line item from Income (loss) from operations to Income (loss) before income taxes in the consolidated statements of income. We also reclassified (gains) losses on our derivative contracts from Other (income) expense to the Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses line item. As a result of these reclassifications, Income (loss) from operations increased $1.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 from the amount previously reported. There was no change to Income (loss) before income taxes or Net income (loss) as a result of these reclassifications.

(2)
Includes $0.3 million of accumulated depreciation related to equipment held under capital leases, as of March 31, 2012 and December 31 2011.
During the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2012, we recorded $5.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively, in depreciation expense of which $1.6 million and $3.8 million, respectively, was recorded in cost of sales, with the remaining amounts recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income.
We periodically review all of our stores for indicators of impairment. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, we determined that certain underperforming domestic stores were unlikely to generate sufficient cash flows to recover the carrying value of the stores assets over the remaining economic life of those assets. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.7 million to adjust the carrying value of these store assets to our estimated of their fair value, which is based on our estimate of future discounted cash flows. During the three months ended March 31, 2011, an insignificant amount of impairment charges were recorded which related to our Sendai, Japan retail store as a result of the March 2011 Japanese earthquakes.

**6\. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**
_Recurring Fair Value Measurements_
The following table summarizes the financial instruments required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Our other financial instruments including accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt and accrued liabilities are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis. The carrying value of these financial instruments approximates fair value due to their short maturities. Based on borrowing rates currently available to us, with similar terms, the carrying values of capital lease obligations and the line of credit approximate their fair values.

_Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements_
The majority of our non-financial instruments including inventories, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis. However, if certain triggering events occur such that a non-financial instrument is determined to be impaired, the non-financial instrument will be recorded at its fair value. See Note 3  Property and Equipment for more information regarding impairment charges related to non-recurring fair value measurements.
_Derivative Financial Instruments_
We transact business in various foreign countries and are therefore exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in revenues, costs, and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. We enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to selectively protect against volatility in the value of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities,

and of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The following table summarizes the notional amounts of the outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts at March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments shown below are denominated in their U.S. dollar equivalents and represent the amount of all contracts of the foreign currency specified. These notional values do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the foreign currency exchange risks.

As of March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, we had issued and outstanding letters of credit of $6.1 million and $6.0 million, respectively, which were reserved against the borrowing base under the terms of our revolving credit facility.
**8\. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION**
Options granted generally vest on a straight-line basis over four years with the first year vesting on a cliff basis followed by monthly vesting for the remaining three years. Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units granted generally vest on a straight-line basis over three or four years depending on the terms of the grant. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable vesting period and is recognized in the cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expense line items in the condensed consolidated statements of income. During the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, $2.1 million and $1.5 million of stock-based compensation expense was recorded, respectively.
During the three months ended March 31, 2012, 0.1 million shares of common stock were issued in connection with stock option exercises and the vesting of restricted stock. During the year ended December 31, 2011, 1.7 million shares of common stock were issued in connection with stock option exercises and the vesting of restricted stock.

**_Restricted Stock Shares and Units_**
From time to time, we grant restricted stock shares and restricted stock units to our employees. Unvested restricted stock shares have the same rights as those of common shares including voting rights and non-forfeitable dividend rights. However, ownership of unvested restricted stock shares cannot be transferred until they are vested. An unvested restricted stock unit (RSU) is a contractual right to receive a share of common stock only upon its vesting. RSUs have dividend equivalent rights which accrue over the term of the award and are paid if and when the RSUs vest, but no voting rights.
During the three months ended March 31, 2012, the Board of Directors approved 0.4 million of restricted stock units to certain executives as part of a performance incentive program. Half of these grants vest ratably on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date; 25% will vest upon achievement of certain performance metrics; and the remaining 25% will vest one year from such date. If actual performance metrics exceed the targeted performance metrics by a predetermined amount, the executives are eligible to receive up to 200% of the performance based share portion of their award. The amount of share-based payment expense related to these units was immaterial during the three months ended March 31, 2012.
The following table summarizes the restricted stock share activity for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011.

**9\. INCOME TAXES**
During the three months ended March 31, 2012, we recognized income tax expense of $7.7 million on pre-tax income of $36.1 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 21.4% compared to an income tax expense of $6.5 million on pre-tax income of $28.0 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 23.2% for the same period in 2011. The change in effective tax rate is primarily the result of the utilization of foreign tax credits on previously repatriated earnings. We had unrecognized tax benefits of $44.4 million at March 31, 2012 and $44.5 million at December 31, 2011.
**10\. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE**
For all periods presented, basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share (EPS) is presented using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for common stock and any participating securities according to dividend rights and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Under the two-class method, EPS is computed by dividing the sum of distributed and undistributed earnings (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. A participating security is an unvested share-based payment award containing non-forfeitable rights to dividends (whether or not declared) and must be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Shares of unvested restricted stock are considered participating securities as they have non-forfeitable dividend rights.
The following table sets forth EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011.

For the three months ended March 31, 2011, approximately 0.7 million options were not included in diluted income (loss) per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
**11\. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**
We lease space for certain of our offices, warehouses, vehicles and equipment under leases expiring at various dates through 2022. Certain leases contain rent escalation clauses (step rents) that require additional rental amounts in the later years of the term. Rent expense for leases with step rents or rent holidays is recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term. Deferred rent is included in the consolidated balance sheet in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Total rent expense was $21.2 million and $17.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Included in such amounts are contingent rents of $2.2 million and $1.7 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

**12\. OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION**
We have three reportable operating segments: Americas, Europe and Asia. We also have an Other businesses category which aggregates insignificant operating segments that do not meet the reportable threshold and represent manufacturing operations located in Mexico and Italy. The composition of our reportable operating segments is consistent with that used by our chief operating decision maker (CODM) to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Each of our reportable operating segments derives its revenues from the sale of footwear, apparel and accessories to external customers. Revenues of the Other businesses category are primarily made up of intersegment sales which are eliminated when deriving total consolidated revenues. The remaining revenues for the Other businesses represent non-footwear product sales to external customers. Segment assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and inventory.
Segment operating income (loss) is the primary measure used by our CODM to evaluate segment operating performance and to decide how to allocate resources to segments. Segment performance evaluation is based primarily on segment results without allocating corporate expenses, or indirect general, administrative and other expenses. Segment profits or losses of our reportable operating segments include adjustments to eliminate intersegment profit or losses on intersegment sales.
During the three months ended March 31, 2012, we changed the internal reports used by our CODM to align the definition of our segment operating income with Income (loss) from operations. Previously, segment operating income (loss) excluded asset impairment charges and restructuring costs not included in cost of sales. Segment operating income also reflects the reclassification of Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net, from Income (loss) from operations on the consolidated statements of income. See Note 1  Basis of Presentation for further discussion. Segment information for all periods presented has been reclassified to reflect these changes.

**13\. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS**
We and certain current and former officers and directors have been named as defendants in complaints filed by investors in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The first complaint was filed in November 2007 and several other complaints were filed shortly thereafter. These actions were consolidated and, in September 2008, the district court appointed a lead plaintiff and counsel. An amended consolidated complaint was filed in December 2008. The amended complaint purports to state claims under Section 10(b), 20(a), and 20A of the Exchange Act on behalf of a class of all persons who purchased our common stock between April 2, 2007 and April 14, 2008 (the Class Period). The amended complaint also added our independent auditor as a defendant. The amended complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, the defendants made false and misleading public statements about us and our business and prospects and, as a result, the market price of our common stock was artificially inflated. The amended complaint also claims that certain current and former officers and directors traded in our common stock on the basis of material non-public information. The amended complaint seeks compensatory damages on behalf of the alleged class in an unspecified amount, including interest, and also added attorneys fees and costs of litigation. On February 28, 2011, the District Court granted motions to dismiss filed by the defendants and dismissed all claims. A final judgment was thereafter entered. Plaintiffs subsequently appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.
We and those current and former officers and directors named as defendants have reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs on terms of a settlement that would, if approved by the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, resolve all claims asserted against us by the plaintiffs on behalf of the putative class, and plaintiffs appeal would be dismissed. Our independent auditor is not a party to the agreement in principle. The agreement in principle contemplates that the settling parties will enter into a Stipulation of Settlement. The Stipulation of Settlement will be subject to customary conditions, including court approval following notice to stockholders. If the settlement becomes final, all amounts required by the settlement will be paid by our insurers. There can be no assurance that the settling parties will enter into a Stipulation of Settlement or that it will be finally approved by the District Court.
On October 27, 2010, Spectrum Agencies (Spectrum) filed suit against our subsidiary, Crocs Europe B.V. (Crocs Europe), in the High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division, Royal Courts of Justice in London, United Kingdom (UK). Spectrum acted as an agent for Crocs products in the UK from 2005 until Crocs Europe terminated the relationship on July 3, 2008 due to Spectrums breach of its duty to act in good faith towards Crocs Europe. Spectrum alleges that Crocs Europe unlawfully terminated the agency relationship and failed to pay certain sales commissions. A trial on the liability, not quantum (compensation and damages), was held at the High Court in London from November 30, 2011 to December 5, 2011. On December 16, 2011, the High Court of Justice issued a judgment that found that although Spectrums actions were a breach of its duty to act in good faith towards Crocs Europe, the breach was not sufficiently severe to justify termination. We believe that the trial judge erred in his findings and permission to appeal the judgment has been requested**.** Given that this phase of the proceedings only pertains to liability, there have been no findings in relation to the amount of compensation or damages other than with respect to legal fees. Under UK law, the prevailing party is entitled to reimbursement of reasonable legal fees incurred in the liability proceedings. Spectrum has not quantified its claim for compensation

and damages and the amount will be assessed later in the proceedings. Such assessment may be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal on liability. We were granted permission to appeal and a trial date has been set for July 2012.
With respect to our outstanding litigation matters, we have accrued an aggregate of $0.4 million in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2012. While we intend to vigorously defend these matters, based on our current knowledge, it is reasonably possible that adverse outcomes could result in aggregate losses beyond accrued amounts. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Due to the nature of these legal proceedings we are currently unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential outcomes. If unfavorable final outcomes were to occur beyond these amounts, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.
We are currently subject to an audit by the U.S. Customs Service in respect of the period from 2006 to present. We anticipate that the U.S. Customs Service will present its audit report to us in the second half of 2012. At this time, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome or estimate potential loss, if any, related to this matter. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur, it may result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.
Although we are subject to other litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including employment, intellectual property and product liability claims, we are not party to any other pending legal proceedings that we believe will have a material adverse impact on its business.

**ITEM 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations**
**Forward-Looking Statements**
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This Item 2, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements. In addition, we may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements. Forward-looking statements include statements as to industry trends and our future expectations and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts and are based on certain assumptions of our management. These statements are often identified by the use of words such as may, will, expect, believe, anticipate, intend, could, estimate, or continue, and similar expressions or variations. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management based on information currently available to us. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include, among others, the risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors under Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We caution the reader to carefully consider such factors. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements.
**Business Overview**
We are a designer, manufacturer, distributor, worldwide marketer and brand manager of footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children. We strive to be the global leader in molded footwear design and development. We design, manufacture and sell a broad product offering that provides new and exciting molded footwear products that feature fun, comfort and functionality. Our products include footwear and accessories that utilize our proprietary closed cell-resin, called Croslite. Our Croslite material is unique in that it enables us to produce an innovative, lightweight, non-marking, and odor-resistant shoe. Certain shoes made with the Croslite material have been certified by U.S. Ergonomics to reduce peak pressure on the foot, reduce muscular fatigue while standing and walking and to relieve the musculoskeletal system.
Since the initial introduction and popularity of our Beach and Crocs Classic designs, we have expanded our Croslite products to include a variety of new styles and products and have extended our product reach through the acquisition of brand platforms such as Jibbitz, LLC (Jibbitz) and Ocean Minded, Inc. (Ocean Minded). We intend to continue branching out into other types of footwear, bringing a unique and original perspective to the consumer in styles that may be unexpected from Crocs. In part, we believe this will help us to continue to build a stable year-round business as we look to offer more winter-oriented styles. Our marketing efforts surround specific product launches and employ a fully integrated approach utilizing a variety of media outlets, including print and online media and television. Our marketing efforts drive business to both our wholesale partners and our company-operated retail and internet stores, ensuring that our presentation and story are first class and drive purchasing at the point of sale.
We currently sell our Crocs-branded products globally through domestic and international retailers and distributors. We also sell our products directly to consumers through our webstores, company-operated retail stores, outlets and kiosks. The broad appeal of our footwear has allowed us to market our products to a wide range of distribution channels, including department stores and traditional footwear retailers as well as a variety of specialty and independent retail channels.
**Financial Highlights**
During the three months ended March 31, 2012, revenues increased $45.1 million to $271.8 million, net income increased $6.8 million to $28.3 million and diluted earnings per share increased $0.07 to $0.31 compared to the same period in 2011. These financial improvements reflect continued strong demand for our diversified product line and improved margins particularly in our Asia operating segment.

_Revenues_. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, revenues increased $45.1 million, or 19.9%, compared to the same period in 2011, due to an increase of 10.6% in average unit selling price and an increase of 1.0 million, or 8.2%, in footwear unit sales.
During the three months ended March 31, 2012, revenues from our wholesale channel grew by $26.1 million, or 15.9%, which was primarily driven by continued strong demand in the Asia operating segment. Revenues from our retail channel grew by $15.1 million, or 33.2%, due to a net increase of 68 global retail stores and growth in comparable store revenues (defined below) of 10.2%. We continue to close certain kiosks and open more branded stores where we can better merchandise the full breadth and depth of our product line. Revenues from our internet channel grew by $3.9 million, or 23.3%, as a result of increased brand awareness.
The table below sets forth information about the number of company-operated retail locations as of March 31, 2012 and 2011 and same store sales growth for the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.

(1) Comparable store status is determined on a monthly basis. Comparable store sales begin in the thirteenth month of a stores operation. Stores in which selling square footage has changed more than 15% as a result of a remodel, expansion or reduction are excluded until the thirteenth month in which they have comparable prior year sales. Temporarily closed stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation during the month of closure. Location closures in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month post re-opening. Comparable store sales growth is calculated on a currency neutral basis using historical annual average rates.

_Impact on Revenues due to Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations._ Changes in average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate revenues from our functional currencies to our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, during the three months ended March 31, 2012 decreased revenues $2.8 million as compared to the same period in 2011. Sales in international markets in foreign currencies are expected to continue to represent a substantial portion of our overall revenues. Accordingly, changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect our overall revenues or the comparability of those revenues from period to period as a result of translating our financial statements into our reporting currency.
_Gross profit._ During the three months ended March 31, 2012, gross profit increased $25.6 million, or 21.5%, compared to the same period in 2011 and gross margin increased slightly to 53.3%. These increases are primarily attributable to an increase of 10.6% in our global average footwear selling price and an increase of 8.2% in global footwear unit sales which were partially offset by higher cost of sales driven by product mix and increased volume.
_Impact on Gross Profit due to Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations._ Changes in average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate revenues and cost of sales from our functional currencies to our reporting currency during the three months ended March 31, 2012 decreased our gross profit by $0.7 million compared to the same period in 2011. We expect our subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar will continue to generate a substantial portion of our overall gross profit. Accordingly, changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect our overall gross profit or the comparability of our gross profit from period to period as a result of translating our financial statements into our reporting currency.
_Selling, general and administrative expenses._ Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) increased $15.5 million, or 17.5%, during the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 which was primarily due to an increase of $5.8 million in salaries and related costs resulting from higher global headcount and an increase of $5.3 million in rent, building and contract labor costs resulting from continued growth in the number of company-operated retail stores, which also contributed to the higher global headcount. As a percentage of revenues; SG&A decreased to 38.3% from 39.1% during the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to the same period 2011.

##### Table of Contents
_Impact on SG &A due to Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations. _Changes in average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate SG&A from our functional currencies to our reporting currency during the three months ended March 31, 2012 decreased SG&A by approximately $0.3 million as compared to the same period in 2011. We expect our subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar will continue to generate a substantial portion of our overall SG&A. Accordingly, changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect our overall SG&A or the comparability of our SG&A from period to period as a result of translating our financial statements into our reporting currency.
_Foreign currency transaction losses (gains)_. Foreign currency transaction losses (gains) is comprised of foreign currency gains and losses from the re-measurement and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments. Losses on foreign currency transactions increased $2.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to $1.4 million of losses during the same period in 2011, primarily due to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in certain non-functional currencies, net of related undesignated forward instruments, as the U.S. dollar strengthened against those currencies.
_Income tax expense_. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, income tax expense increased $1.2 million compared to the same period in 2011, which was primarily due to increased profitability of various domestic and international jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate primarily because of differences between income tax rates between US and foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2012 was 1.8% lower than the rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 primarily due to the utilization of foreign tax credits on previously repatriated earnings.
**Presentation of Reportable Operating Segments**
We have three reportable operating segments: Americas, Europe and Asia. We also have an Other businesses category which aggregates insignificant operating segments that do not meet the reportable threshold and represent manufacturing operations located in Mexico and Italy. The composition of our reportable operating segments is consistent with that used by our chief operating decision maker (CODM) to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Each of our reportable operating segments derives its revenues from the sale of footwear, apparel and accessories to external customers. Revenues of the Other businesses category are primarily made up of intersegment sales which are eliminated when deriving total consolidated revenues. The remaining revenues for the Other businesses represent non-footwear product sales to external customers. Segment assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and inventory.
Segment operating income (loss) is the primary measure used by our CODM to evaluate segment operating performance and to decide how to allocate resources to segments. Segment performance evaluation is based primarily on segment results without allocating corporate expenses, or indirect general, administrative and other expenses. Segment profits or losses of our reportable operating segments include adjustments to eliminate intersegment profit or losses on intersegment sales.
During the three months ended March 31, 2012, for operational purposes, we changed the internal reports used by our CODM to align the definition of our segment operating income with Income (loss) from operations. Previously, segment operating income (loss) was a non-GAAP measure and excluded asset impairment charges and restructuring costs not included in cost of sales. Segment operating income also reflects the reclassification of Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net, from Income (loss) from operations on the consolidated statements of income, see Note 1  Basis of Presentation for further discussion. Segment information for all periods presented has been reclassified to reflect these changes.

During the quarter ended March 31, 2012, operating losses of Other businesses decreased $2.6 million compared to the same period in 20ll, primarily due to an increase of $2.9 million of intercompany revenues driven by higher global sales which was partially offset by increased volume and product mix related cost of sales.
(2)
Includes a corporate component consisting primarily of corporate support and administrative functions, costs associated with share-based compensation, research and development, brand marketing, legal, depreciation on corporate and other assets not allocated to operating segments and costs of the same nature of certain corporate holding companies. For the quarter ended March 31, 2012, operating losses from Unallocated corporate and other increased $4.2 million compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due increased salaries and wages associated with higher corporate headcount.
_Americas Operating Segment_. Revenues from the Americas segment increased $17.1 million, or 17.1%, during the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to a 13.3% increase in footwear units sold and a 3.0% increase in footwear average selling price, which were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of $0.7 million from foreign currency fluctuations. Revenue growth for the region was realized primarily in the wholesale channel which increased $7.2 million, or 11.6%, and in the retail channel which increased $7.1 million, or 25.1%. Segment operating income increased by $2.3 million, or 14.3%, driven mainly by the increase in revenues which was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin and an increase of $2.8 million, or 7.9%, in SG&A which resulted from the continued expansion of the retail channel. Foreign currency fluctuations had an insignificant net impact on the Americas gross margin and operating income.
_Asia Operating Segment_. Revenues from the Asia segment increased $29.4 million, or 40.5%, during the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to a 23.6% increase in footwear units sold, an 11.4% increase in footwear average selling price and a favorable impact of $1.4 million from foreign currency fluctuations. Revenue growth for the region was realized primarily in the wholesale channel which increased $22.0 million, or 38.8%, and in the retail channel which increased $6.4 million, or 45.5% and was primarily driven by new stores and same store growth. Segment operating income increased by $12.7 million, or 65.8%, which was driven mainly by the increase in revenues and an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase of $7.4 million, or 31.4%, in SG&A which resulted from the continued expansion of the retail channel. Foreign currency fluctuations had an insignificant net impact on the Asia gross margin and operating income.
_Europe Operating Segment_. Revenues from the Europe segment decreased $1.5 million, or 2.7%, during the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to a 16.2% decrease in footwear units sold and a $2.4 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations which were partially offset by an 18.9% increase in footwear average selling price. A decrease of $3.2 million, or 6.9%, in wholesale channel revenues drove the decline in total segment revenues which was primarily due to deteriorating macro economic conditions in Europe. An increase of $1.5 million, or 52.2% in the retail channel partially offset the decline in wholesale revenues. Segment operating income decreased by $3.3 million, or 18.7%, driven mainly by the decrease in revenues, a lower gross margin and an increase of $2.0 million, or 18.0%, in SG&A which resulted from the continued expansion of the retail channel. Foreign currency fluctuations had a net negative impact of $1.2 million and $0.7 million on the Europe gross profit and operating income, respectively.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**
At March 31, 2012, we had $206.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. We anticipate that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet the ongoing needs of our business for the next twelve months. In order to provide additional liquidity in the future and to help support our strategic goals, we also have a revolving credit facility with PNC Bank, N.A. (PNC) and a syndicate of other lenders (further discussed below), which currently provides us with up to $70.0 million in borrowings and matures in December 2016. Additional future financing may be necessary, however, there can be no assurance that, if needed, we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.
**_Credit Facility_**
On December 16, 2011, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of lenders, including PNC, which replaced our asset-backed line of credit. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $70.0 million (the Credit Facility), which can be increased to $100.0 million subject to certain conditions. The Credit Facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and stock repurchases, and is currently set to mature in December 2016. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by all of our assets including all receivables, equipment, general intangibles, inventory, investment property, subsidiary stock and intellectual property. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate. For domestic rate loans, the interest rate is equal to the highest of (i) the daily federal funds open rate as quoted by ICAP North America, Inc. plus 0.5%, (ii) PNCs prime rate and (iii) a daily LIBOR rate plus 1.0%, in each case there is an additional margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.50% based on certain conditions. For LIBOR rate loans, the interest rate is equal to a LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.50% based on certain conditions. The Credit Agreement requires monthly interest payments with respect to domestic rate loans and at the end of each interest period with respect to LIBOR rate loans and contains certain customary restrictive and financial covenants. We were in compliance with these restrictive financial covenants as of March 31, 2012. As of March 31, 2012, we had $24.1 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. At March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, we had issued and outstanding letters of credit of $6.1 million and $6.0 million, respectively, which were reserved against the borrowing base.
**_Working Capital_**
As of March 31, 2012, accounts receivable increased $80.3 million when compared to December 31, 2011, primarily due to increased sales in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Inventories increased $39.4 million as of March 31, 2012 when compared to December 2011, primarily due to wholesale order growth, particularly in the Americas and Asia, and the global increase in company-operated retail stores.
**_Capital Assets_**
During the three months ended March 31, 2012, net capital expenditures, inclusive of intangible assets, remained relatively flat at $9.4 million compared to $9.3 million during the same period in 2011 as we continue our global retail store growth.
We have entered into various operating leases that require cash payments on a specified schedule. Over the next five years we are committed to make payments of approximately $190.1 million related to our operating leases. We plan to continue to enter into operating leases related to our retail stores. We also continue to evaluate cost reduction opportunities. Our evaluation of cost reduction opportunities will include an evaluation of contracts for sponsorships, operating lease contracts and other contracts that require future minimum payments resulting in fixed operating costs. Any changes to these contracts may require early termination fees or other charges that could result in significant cash expenditures.
**_Repatriation of Cash_**
As we are a global business, we have cash balances which are located in various countries and are denominated in various currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations and cash positions. Future fluctuations in foreign currencies may have a material impact on our cash flows and capital resources. Cash balances held in foreign countries have additional restrictions and covenants associated with them which adds increased strains on our liquidity and ability to timely access and transfer cash balances between entities.
We generally consider unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. to be indefinitely reinvested and it is not our current intent to change this position with the exception of the expected repatriation of up to approximately $13.6 million in cash that was previously accrued for as a repatriation of 2010 foreign subsidiary current-year earnings. Most of the cash balances held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S., but under current law, would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. In some countries, repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws and could have adverse tax consequences if we were to move the cash to another country. Certain countries, including China, have monetary laws which may limit our ability to utilize cash resources in those countries for operations in other countries. These limitations may affect our ability to fully utilize our cash resources for needs in the U.S. or other countries and could adversely affect our liquidity. As of March 31, 2012, essentially all of our cash was held in international jurisdictions, which is primarily used for ongoing operations. Of the total cash held in international locations, $36.2 million could potentially be restricted. If the remaining balance were to be

immediately repatriated to the U.S., we would be required to pay approximately $26.5 million in taxes that were not previously provided for in our consolidated statement of operations.

**_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_**
We had no material off balance sheet arrangements at March 31, 2012.
**Seasonality**
Due to the seasonal nature of our footwear which is more heavily focused on styles suitable for warm weather, revenues generated during our first and fourth quarters are typically less than revenues generated during our second and third quarters, when the northern hemisphere is experiencing warmer weather. We continue to expand our product line to include more winter-oriented styles to mitigate some of the seasonality of our revenues. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including the timing of new model introductions or general economic or consumer conditions. Accordingly, results of operations and cash flows for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any other year.
**Critical Accounting Policies**
For a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to our business operations and understanding of our results of operations, and that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and incorporated by reference herein.
**Significant Accounting Policies**
For a discussion of accounting policies that we consider significant to our business operations and understanding of our results of operations, see Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and incorporated by reference herein.
## ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
**Interest Rate Risk**
Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate. For domestic rate loans, the interest rate is equal to the highest of (i) the daily federal funds open rate as quoted by ICAP North America, Inc. plus 0.5%, (ii) PNCs prime rate and (iii) a daily LIBOR rate plus 1.0%, in each case there is an additional margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.50% based on certain conditions. For LIBOR rate loans, the interest rate is equal to a LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.50% based on certain conditions. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are therefore subject to risk based upon prevailing market interest rates. Interest rate risk may result from many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control. During the quarter ended March 31, 2012, the maximum amount borrowed under the Credit Facility was $31.0 million and the average amount of borrowings outstanding was $12.5 million. As of March 31, 2012, the amount of total borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility was $24.1 million. If the prevailing market interest rates relative to these borrowings increased by 10% during the quarter ended March 31, 2012, our interest expense would have not have materially increased.
23
* * *
##### Table of Contents
Fluctuations in the prevailing market interest rates, earned on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances during the three months ended March 31, 2012, would have an immaterial impact on the consolidated statements of income.
**Foreign Currency Exchange Risk**
As a global company, we have significant revenues, costs and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We pay the majority of expenses attributable to our foreign operations in the functional currency of the country in which such operations are conducted and pay the majority of our overseas third-party manufacturers in U.S. dollars. Our ability to sell our products in foreign markets and the U.S. dollar value of the sales made in foreign currencies can be significantly influenced by foreign currency fluctuations. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could result in downward price pressure for our products and increase losses from currency exchange rates. An increase of 1% in value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would have decreased income before taxes during the quarter ended March 31, 2012, excluding the impact of our foreign currency contracts, by approximately $2.0 million. The volatility of the applicable exchange rates is dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. In the event our foreign sales and purchases increase and are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies we receive for such sales. See Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for a discussion of the impact of foreign exchange rate variances experienced during the quarters ended March 31, 2012 and 2011.
We enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges to reduce our exposure to the effect of changes in exchange rates on our operating results. The following table summarizes the notional amounts of the outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts at March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments shown below are denominated in their U.S. dollar equivalents and represent the amount of all contracts of the foreign currency specified. These notional values do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the foreign currency exchange risks.

## ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures
**_Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_**
Under the supervision of and with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as March 31, 2012 (the Evaluation Date). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, such that the information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
**_Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_**
There have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
**PART IIOTHER INFORMATION**
## ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings
We and certain current and former officers and directors have been named as defendants in complaints filed by investors in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The first complaint was filed in November 2007 and several other complaints were filed shortly thereafter. These actions were consolidated and, in September 2008, the district court appointed a lead plaintiff and counsel. An amended consolidated complaint was filed in December 2008. The amended complaint purports to state claims under
24
* * *
##### Table of Contents
Section 10(b), 20(a), and 20A of the Exchange Act on behalf of a class of all persons who purchased our common stock between April 2, 2007 and April 14, 2008 (the Class Period). The amended complaint also added our independent auditor as a defendant. The amended complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, the defendants made false and misleading public statements about us and our business and prospects and, as a result, the market price of our common stock was artificially inflated. The amended complaint also claims that certain current and former officers and directors traded in our common stock on the basis of material non-public information. The amended complaint seeks compensatory damages on behalf of the alleged class in an unspecified amount, including interest, and also added attorneys fees and costs of litigation. On February 28, 2011, the District Court granted motions to dismiss filed by the defendants and dismissed all claims. A final judgment was thereafter entered. Plaintiffs subsequently appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.
We and those current and former officers and directors named as defendants have reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs on terms of a settlement that would, if approved by the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, resolve all claims asserted against us by the plaintiffs on behalf of the putative class, and plaintiffs appeal would be dismissed. Our independent auditor is not a party to the agreement in principle. The agreement in principle contemplates that the settling parties will enter into a Stipulation of Settlement. The Stipulation of Settlement will be subject to customary conditions, including court approval following notice to stockholders. If the settlement becomes final, all amounts required by the settlement will be paid by our insurers. There can be no assurance that the settling parties will enter into a Stipulation of Settlement or that it will be finally approved by the District Court.
On October 27, 2010, Spectrum Agencies (Spectrum) filed suit against our subsidiary, Crocs Europe B.V. (Crocs Europe), in the High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division, Royal Courts of Justice in London, United Kingdom (UK). Spectrum acted as an agent for Crocs products in the UK from 2005 until Crocs Europe terminated the relationship on July 3, 2008 due to Spectrums breach of its duty to act in good faith towards Crocs Europe. Spectrum alleges that Crocs Europe unlawfully terminated the agency relationship and failed to pay certain sales commissions. A trial on the liability, not quantum (compensation and damages), was held at the High Court in London from November 30, 2011 to December 5, 2011. On December 16, 2011, the High Court of Justice issued a judgment that found that although Spectrums actions were a breach of its duty to act in good faith towards Crocs Europe, the breach was not sufficiently severe to justify termination. We believe that the trial judge erred in his findings and permission to appeal the judgment has been requested**.** Given that this phase of the proceedings only pertains to liability, there have been no findings in relation to the amount of compensation or damages other than with respect to legal fees. Under UK law, the prevailing party is entitled to reimbursement of reasonable legal fees incurred in the liability proceedings. Spectrum has not quantified its claim for compensation and damages and the amount will be assessed later in the proceedings. Such assessment may be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal on liability. We were granted permission to appeal and a trial date has been set for July 2012.
We are currently subject to an audit by the U.S. Customs Service in respect of the period from 2006 to present. We anticipate that the U.S. Customs Service will present its audit report to us in the second half of 2012. At this time, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome or estimate potential loss, if any, related to this matter. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur, it may result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.
We intend to vigorously defend these matters. Although we are subject to other litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including employment, intellectual property and product liability claims, we are not party to any other pending legal proceedings that we believe will have a material adverse impact on its business.

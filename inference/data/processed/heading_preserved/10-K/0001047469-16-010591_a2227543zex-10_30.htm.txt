2.1.2 _Swing Loan Commitment._ Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, and in order to facilitate loans and repayments between Settlement Dates, PNC may, at its option, cancelable at any time for any reason whatsoever, make swing loans (the **Swing Loans** ) to the Borrower at any time or from time to time after the date hereof to the Expiration Date, in an aggregate principal amount up to but not in excess of the Swing Loan Commitment, provided that after giving effect to such Loan, the Revolving Facility Usage shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Commitments. Within such limits of time and amount and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow pursuant to this Section 2.1.2.
2.2 _Nature of Lenders Obligations with Respect to Revolving Credit Loans._ Each Lender shall be obligated to participate in each request for Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to Section 2.4 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests; Swing Loan Requests] in accordance with its Ratable Share. The aggregate of each Lenders Revolving Credit Loans outstanding hereunder to the Borrower at any time shall never exceed its Revolving Credit Commitment minus its Ratable Share of the outstanding Swing Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations. The obligations of each Lender hereunder are several. The failure of any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder shall not affect the Obligations of the Borrower to any other party nor shall any other party be liable for the failure of such Lender to perform its obligations hereunder. The Lenders shall have no obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans hereunder on or after the Expiration Date.
2.3 _Commitment Fees._ Accruing from the date hereof until the Expiration Date, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender according to its Ratable Share, a nonrefundable commitment fee (the **Commitment Fee** ) equal to the Applicable Commitment Fee Rate (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed) multiplied by the average daily difference between the amount of (i) the Revolving Credit Commitments (for purposes of this computation, PNCs Swing Loans shall be deemed to be borrowed amounts under its Revolving Credit Commitment) and (ii) the Revolving Facility Usage; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Commitment Fee accrued with respect to the Revolving Credit Commitment of a Defaulting Lender during the period prior to the time such Lender became a Defaulting Lender and unpaid at such time shall not be payable by the Borrower so long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender except to the
30
* * *


extent that such Commitment Fee shall otherwise have been due and payable by the Borrower prior to such time; and _provided further_ that no Commitment Fee shall accrue with respect to the Revolving Commitment of a Defaulting Lender so long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender. Subject to the proviso in the directly preceding sentence, all Commitment Fees shall be payable in arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter with respect to the previous calendar quarter.
2.4 _Revolving Credit Loan Requests; Swing Loan Requests._
2.4.1 _Revolving Credit Loan Requests_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Borrower may from time to time prior to the Expiration Date request the Lenders to make Revolving Credit Loans, or renew or convert the Interest Rate Option applicable to existing Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to Section 4.2 [Interest Periods], by delivering to the Administrative Agent, not later than 1:00 p.m., (i) three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed Borrowing Date with respect to the making of Revolving Credit Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies or the conversion to or the renewal of the LIBOR Rate Option for any Loans; and (ii) the same Business Day of the proposed Borrowing Date with respect to the making of a Revolving Credit Loan to which the Base Rate Option applies or the last day of the preceding Interest Period with respect to the conversion to the Base Rate Option for any Loan, of a duly completed request therefor substantially in the form of _Exhibit 2.4.1_ or a request by telephone promptly confirmed in writing by letter, facsimile or telex in such form (each, a **Loan Request** ), it being understood that the Administrative Agent may rely on the authority of any individual making such a telephonic request without the necessity of receipt of such written confirmation. Each Loan Request shall be irrevocable and shall specify the aggregate amount of the proposed Loans comprising each Borrowing Tranche, and, if applicable, the Interest Period, which amounts shall be in (x) integral multiples of $500,000 and not less than $1,000,000 for each Borrowing Tranche under the LIBOR Rate Option, and (y) integral multiples of $500,000 and not less than $500,000 for each Borrowing Tranche under the Base Rate Option.
2.4.2 _Swing Loan Requests_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Borrower may from time to time prior to the Expiration Date request PNC to make Swing Loans by delivery to PNC not later than 1:00 p.m. on the proposed Borrowing Date of a duly completed request therefor substantially in the form of _Exhibit 2.4.2_ hereto or a request by telephone promptly confirmed in writing by letter, facsimile or telex (each, a **Swing Loan Request** ), it being understood that the Administrative Agent may rely on the authority of any individual making such a telephonic request without the necessity of receipt of such written confirmation. Each Swing Loan Request shall be irrevocable and shall specify the proposed Borrowing Date and the principal amount of such Swing Loan, which shall be not less than $1,000,000.
2.5 _Making Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Loans; Presumptions by the Administrative Agent; Repayment of Revolving Credit Loans; Borrowings to Repay Swing Loans._
2.5.1 _Making Revolving Credit Loans._ The Administrative Agent shall, promptly after receipt by it of a Loan Request pursuant to Section 2.4 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests; Swing Loan Requests], notify the Lenders of its receipt of such Loan Request specifying the information provided by the Borrower and the apportionment among the Lenders
31
* * *


of the requested Revolving Credit Loans as determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.2 [Nature of Lenders Obligations with Respect to Revolving Credit Loans]. Each Lender shall remit the principal amount of each Revolving Credit Loan to the Administrative Agent such that the Administrative Agent is able to, and the Administrative Agent shall, to the extent the Lenders have made funds available to it for such purpose and subject to Section 7.2 [Each Loan or Letter of Credit], fund such Revolving Credit Loans to the Borrower in U.S. Dollars and immediately available funds at the Principal Office prior to 2:00 p.m., on the applicable Borrowing Date; _provided_ that if any Lender fails to remit such funds to the Administrative Agent in a timely manner, the Administrative Agent may elect in its sole discretion to fund with its own funds the Revolving Credit Loans of such Lender on such Borrowing Date, and such Lender shall be subject to the repayment obligation in Section 2.5.2 [Presumptions by the Administrative Agent].
2.5.2 _Presumptions by the Administrative Agent._ Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Loan that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Loan, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.5.1 [Making Revolving Credit Loans] and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Loan available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Loans under the Base Rate Option; _provided_ , _however_ , that Agent shall first make demand for repayment upon such Lender prior to making demand on Borrowers. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
2.5.3 _Making Swing Loans_. So long as PNC elects to make Swing Loans, PNC shall, after receipt by it of a Swing Loan Request pursuant to Section 2.4.2, [Swing Loan Requests] fund such Swing Loan to the Borrower in U.S. Dollars and immediately available funds at the Principal Office prior to 4:00 p.m. on the Borrowing Date.
2.5.4 _Repayment of Revolving Credit Loans._ The Borrower shall repay the Revolving Credit Loans together with all outstanding interest thereon on the Expiration Date.
2.5.5 _Borrowings to Repay Swing Loans_. PNC may, at its option, exercisable at any time for any reason whatsoever, demand repayment of the Swing Loans, and each Lender shall make a Revolving Credit Loan in an amount equal to such Lenders Ratable Share of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Swing Loans, plus, if PNC so requests, accrued interest thereon, _provided_ that no Lender shall be obligated in any event to make Revolving Credit Loans in excess of its Revolving Credit Commitment minus its Ratable Share of Letter of Credit Obligations. Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall bear interest at the Base Rate Option and shall be deemed to have been properly requested in
32
* * *


accordance with Section 2.4.1 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests] without regard to any of the requirements of that provision. PNC shall provide notice to the Lenders (which may be telephonic or written notice by letter, facsimile or telex) that such Revolving Credit Loans are to be made under this Section 2.5.5 and of the apportionment among the Lenders, and the Lenders shall be unconditionally obligated to fund such Revolving Credit Loans (whether or not the conditions specified in Section 2.4.1 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests] are then satisfied) by the time PNC so requests, which shall not be earlier than 3:00 p.m. on the Business Day next after the date the Lenders receive such notice from PNC.
2.5.6 _Swing Loans Under Cash Management Agreements._ In addition to making Swing Loans pursuant to the foregoing provisions of Section 2.5.3 [Making Swing Loans], without the requirement for a specific request from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.4.2 [Swing Loan Requests], PNC as the Swing Loan Lender may make Swing Loans to the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of the agreements between the Borrower and such Swing Loan Lender relating to the Borrowers deposit, sweep and other accounts at such Swing Loan Lender and related arrangements and agreements regarding the management and investment of the Borrowers cash assets as in effect from time to time (the Cash Management Agreements) to the extent of the daily aggregate net negative balance in the Borrowers accounts which are subject to the provisions of the Cash Management Agreements. Swing Loans made pursuant to this Section 2.5.6 in accordance with the provisions of the Cash Management Agreements shall (i) be subject to the limitations as to aggregate amount set forth in Section 2.1.2 [Swing Loan Commitment], (ii) not be subject to the limitations as to individual amount set forth in Section 2.4.2 [Swing Loan Requests], (iii) be payable by the Borrower, both as to principal and interest, at the rates and times set forth in the Cash Management Agreements (but in no event later than the Expiration Date), (iv) not be made at any time after such Swing Loan Lender has received written notice of the occurrence of an Event of Default and so long as such shall continue to exist, or, unless consented to by the Required Lenders, a Potential Default and so long as such shall continue to exist, (v) if not repaid by the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of the Cash Management Agreements, be subject to each Lenders obligation pursuant to Section 2.5.5 [Borrowings to Repay Swing Loans], and (vi) except as provided in the foregoing subsections (i) through (v), be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Section 2.
2.6 _Notes._ The Obligation of the Borrower to repay the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Loans made to it by each Lender, together with interest thereon, shall be evidenced by a revolving credit Note and a swing Note dated the Closing Date payable to the order of such Lender in a face amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment or Swing Loan Commitment as applicable, of such Lender.
2.7 _Use of Proceeds._ The proceeds of the Loans shall be used (i) to pay fees and expenses relating to this transaction, (ii) for Borrowers working capital needs and capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes, (iii) to finance Permitted Acquisitions (including fees and expenses related to Permitted Acquisitions), (iv) to reimburse drawings under Letters of Credit, and (v) for other permitted uses hereunder, including, but not limited to, permitted dividends, distributions, purchases, redemptions and retirements of equity interests.(31)

2.8 _Letter of Credit Subfacility._
2.8.1 _Issuance of Letters of Credit._ The Borrower may at any time prior to the Expiration Date request the issuance of a standby or trade letter of credit (each a **Letter of Credit** ) on behalf of itself or another Loan Party, or the amendment or extension of an existing Letter of Credit, by delivering or having such other Loan Party deliver to the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a completed application and agreement for letters of credit, or request for such amendment or extension, as applicable, in such form as the Issuing Lender may specify from time to time by no later than 10:00 a.m. at least five (5) Business Days, or such shorter period as may be agreed to by the Issuing Lender, in advance of the proposed date of issuance. Promptly after receipt of any letter of credit application, the Issuing Lender shall confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit application and if not, such Issuing Lender will provide Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the Issuing Lender has received notice from any Lender, Administrative Agent or the Borrower, at least one day prior to the requested date of issuance, amendment or extension of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions in Section 7 [Conditions of Lending and Issuance of Letters of Credit] is not satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in reliance on the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.8, the Issuing Lender or any of the Issuing Lenders Affiliates will issue a Letter of Credit or agree to such amendment or extension, provided that each Letter of Credit shall (A) have a maximum maturity of twelve (12) months from the date of issuance, and (B) in no event expire later than the Expiration Date and provided further that in no event shall (i) the Letter of Credit Obligations exceed, at any one time, $20,000,000 (the **Letter of Credit Sublimit** ) or (ii) the Revolving Facility Usage exceed, at any one time, the Revolving Credit Commitments. Each request by the Borrower for the issuance, amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by the Borrower that it shall be in compliance with the preceding sentence and with Section 7 [Conditions of Lending and Issuance of Letters of Credit] after giving effect to the requested issuance, amendment or extension of such Letter of Credit. Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable Issuing Lender will also deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.
2.8.2 _Letter of Credit Fees_. The Borrower shall pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders a fee (the **Letter of Credit Fee** ) equal to the Applicable Letter of Credit Fee Rate, and (ii) to the Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee equal to .125% per annum (in each case computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed), which fees shall be computed on the daily average Letter of Credit Obligations and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter. The Borrower shall also pay to the Issuing Lender for the Issuing Lenders sole account the Issuing Lenders then in effect customary fees and administrative expenses payable with respect to the Letters of Credit as the Issuing Lender may generally charge or incur from time to time in connection with the issuance, maintenance, amendment (if any), assignment or transfer (if any), negotiation, and administration of Letters of Credit.
2.8.3 _Disbursements, Reimbursement_. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
34
* * *


agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Lender a participation in such Letter of Credit and each drawing thereunder in an amount equal to such Lenders Ratable Share of the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively.
2.8.3.1 In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Provided that it shall have received such notice, the Borrower shall reimburse (such obligation to reimburse the Issuing Lender shall sometimes be referred to as a **Reimbursement Obligation** ) the Issuing Lender prior to 12:00 noon on each date that an amount is paid by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit (each such date, a **Drawing Date** ) by paying to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender an amount equal to the amount so paid by the Issuing Lender. In the event the Borrower fails to reimburse the Issuing Lender (through the Administrative Agent) for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by 12:00 noon on the Drawing Date, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender thereof, and the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested that Revolving Credit Loans be made by the Lenders under the Base Rate Option to be disbursed on the Drawing Date under such Letter of Credit, subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Loan or Letter of Credit] other than any notice requirements. Any notice given by the Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.8.3.1 may be oral if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.
2.8.3.2 Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.8.3.1 make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender an amount in immediately available funds equal to its Ratable Share of the amount of the drawing, whereupon the participating Lenders shall (subject to Section 2.8.3 [Disbursement; Reimbursement]) each be deemed to have made a Revolving Credit Loan under the Base Rate Option to the Borrower in that amount. If any Lender so notified fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender the amount of such Lenders Ratable Share of such amount by no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Drawing Date, then interest shall accrue on such Lenders obligation to make such payment, from the Drawing Date to the date on which such Lender makes such payment (i) at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate during the first three (3) days following the Drawing Date and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to Loans under the Revolving Credit Base Rate Option on and after the fourth day following the Drawing Date. The Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender will promptly give notice (as described in Section 2.8.3.1 above) of the occurrence of the Drawing Date, but failure of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender to give any such notice on the Drawing Date or in sufficient time to enable any Lender to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Lender from its obligation under this Section 2.8.3.2.
2.8.3.3 With respect to any unreimbursed drawing that is not converted into Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option to the Borrower in whole or in part as contemplated by Section 2.8.3.1, because of the Borrowers failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Loan or Letter of Credit] other than any notice requirements, or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the Issuing Lender a borrowing (each a **Letter of Credit Borrowing** ) in the amount of such drawing. Such Letter
35
* * *


of Credit Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option. Each Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.8.3 [Disbursements, Reimbursement] shall be deemed to be a payment in respect of its participation in such Letter of Credit Borrowing (each a **Participation Advance** ) from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.8.3.
2.8.4 _Repayment of Participation Advances._
2.8.4.1 Upon (and only upon) receipt by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender of immediately available funds from the Borrower (i) in reimbursement of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under the Letter of Credit with respect to which any Lender has made a Participation Advance to the Administrative Agent, or (ii) in payment of interest on such a payment made by the Issuing Lender under such a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Issuing Lender will pay to each Lender, in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent, the amount of such Lenders Ratable Share of such funds, except the Administrative Agent shall retain for the account of the Issuing Lender the amount of the Ratable Share of such funds of any Lender that did not make a Participation Advance in respect of such payment by the Issuing Lender.
2.8.4.2 If the Administrative Agent is required at any time to return to any Loan Party, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or any official in any Insolvency Proceeding, any portion of any payment made by any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section in reimbursement of a payment made under the Letter of Credit or interest or fee thereon, each Lender shall, on demand of the Administrative Agent, forthwith return to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender the amount of its Ratable Share of any amounts so returned by the Administrative Agent plus interest thereon from the date such demand is made to the date such amounts are returned by such Lender to the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect from time to time.
2.8.5 _Documentation._ Each Loan Party agrees to be bound by the terms of the Issuing Lenders application and agreement for letters of credit and the Issuing Lenders written regulations and customary practices relating to letters of credit, though such interpretation may be different from such Loan Partys own. In the event of a conflict between such application or agreement and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. It is understood and agreed that, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Issuing Lender shall not be liable for any error, negligence and/or mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in following any Loan Partys instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or any modifications, amendments or supplements thereto.
2.8.6 _Determinations to Honor Drawing Requests._ In determining whether to honor any request for drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Lender shall be responsible only to determine that the documents and certificates required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit have been delivered and that they comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit.

2.8.7 _Nature of Participation and Reimbursement Obligations._ Each Lenders obligation in accordance with this Agreement to make the Revolving Credit Loans or Participation Advances, as contemplated by Section 2.8.3 [Disbursements, Reimbursement], as a result of a drawing under a Letter of Credit, and the Obligations of the Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Lender upon a draw under a Letter of Credit, shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.8 under all circumstances, including the following circumstances:

(iii) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit;
(iv) any claim of breach of warranty that might be made by any Loan Party or any Lender against any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit, or the existence of any claim, set-off, recoupment, counterclaim, crossclaim, defense or other right which any Loan Party or any Lender may have at any time against a beneficiary, successor beneficiary any transferee or assignee of any Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof (or any Persons for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates or any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including any underlying transaction between any Loan Party or Subsidiaries of a Loan Party and the beneficiary for which any Letter of Credit was procured);
(v) the lack of power or authority of any signer of (or any defect in or forgery of any signature or endorsement on) or the form of or lack of validity, sufficiency, accuracy, enforceability or genuineness of any draft, demand, instrument, certificate or other document presented under or in connection with any Letter of Credit, or any fraud or alleged fraud in connection with any Letter of Credit, or the transport of any property or provision of services relating to a Letter of Credit, in each case even if the Issuing Lender or any of its Affiliates has been notified thereof;

(viii) any failure by the Issuing Lender or any of its Affiliates to issue any Letter of Credit in the form requested by any Loan Party, unless the Issuing Lender has received written notice from such Loan Party of such failure within three Business Days after the Issuing Lender shall have furnished such Loan Party and the Administrative Agent a copy of such Letter of Credit and such error is material and no drawing has been made thereon prior to receipt of such notice;
(ix) any adverse change in the business, operations, properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of any Loan Party or Subsidiaries of a Loan Party;

2.8.9 _Liability for Acts and Omissions._ As between any Loan Party and the Issuing Lender, or the Issuing Lenders Affiliates, such Loan Party assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for any of the following, including any losses or damages to any Loan Party or
38
* * *


other Person or property relating therefrom: (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for an issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged (even if the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates shall have been notified thereof); (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) the failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit, or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred, to comply fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit or any other claim of any Loan Party against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, or any such transferee, or any dispute between or among any Loan Party and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any such transferee; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates, as applicable, including any act or omission of any Official Body, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of the Issuing Lenders or its Affiliates rights or powers hereunder. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall relieve the Issuing Lender from liability for the Issuing Lenders gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with actions or omissions described in such clauses (i) through (viii) of such sentence. In no event shall the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates be liable to any Loan Party for any indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or special damages or expenses (including without limitation attorneys fees), or for any damages resulting from any change in the value of any property relating to a Letter of Credit.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Issuing Lender and each of its Affiliates (i) may rely on any oral or other communication believed in good faith by the Issuing Lender or such Affiliate to have been authorized or given by or on behalf of the applicant for a Letter of Credit, (ii) may honor any presentation if the documents presented appear on their face substantially to comply with the terms and conditions of the relevant Letter of Credit; (iii) may honor a previously dishonored presentation under a Letter of Credit, whether such dishonor was pursuant to a court order, to settle or compromise any claim of wrongful dishonor, or otherwise, and shall be entitled to reimbursement to the same extent as if such presentation had initially been honored, together with any interest paid by the Issuing Lender or its Affiliate; (iv) may honor any drawing that is payable upon presentation of a statement advising negotiation or payment, upon receipt of such statement (even if such statement indicates that a draft or other document is being delivered separately), and shall not be liable for any failure of any such draft or other document to arrive, or to conform in any way with the relevant Letter of Credit; (v) may pay any paying or negotiating bank claiming that it rightfully honored under the laws or practices of the place where such bank is located; and (vi) may settle or adjust any claim or demand made on the Issuing Lender or its Affiliate in any way related to any order issued at the applicants request to an air carrier, a letter of guarantee or of indemnity issued to a carrier or any similar document (each an **Order** ) and honor any drawing in connection with any Letter of Credit that
39
* * *


is the subject of such Order, notwithstanding that any drafts or other documents presented in connection with such Letter of Credit fail to conform in any way with such Letter of Credit.
In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions set forth above, any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put the Issuing Lender or its Affiliates under any resulting liability to the Borrower or any Lender.
2.8.10 _Issuing Lender Reporting Requirements._ Each Issuing Lender shall, on the first Business Day of each month, provide to Administrative Agent and Borrower a schedule of the Letters of Credit issued by it, in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent, showing the date of issuance of each Letter of Credit, the account party, the original face amount (if any), and the expiration date of any Letter of Credit outstanding at any time during the preceding month, and any other information relating to such Letter of Credit that the Administrative Agent may request.
2.9 _Defaulting Lenders_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(i) fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.3 [Commitment Fees];
(ii) the Commitment and outstanding Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 11.2 [Modifications, Amendments or Waivers]); provided, that this clause (ii) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification that increases the Commitments of such Lender, provides for an extension of the Expiration Date for such Lenders Loans, or alters the definition of Required Lenders;
(iii) if any Swing Loans are outstanding or any Letter of Credit Obligations exist at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then:
(a) all or any part of the outstanding Swing Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Ratable Shares but only to the extent that (x) the Revolving Facility Usage does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Commitments, and (y) no Potential Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time;
(b) if the reallocation described in clause (a) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x)  _first_ , prepay such outstanding Swing Loans, and (y)  _second_ , cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Lender the Borrowers obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Obligations (after giving effect to any partial
40
* * *


reallocation pursuant to clause (a) above) in a deposit account held at the Administrative Agent for so long as such Letter of Credit Obligations are outstanding;
(c) if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Obligations pursuant to clause (b) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.8.2 [Letter of Credit Fees] with respect to such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Obligations during the period such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Obligations are cash collateralized;
(d) if the Letter of Credit Obligations of the non-Defaulting Lenders are reallocated pursuant to clause (a) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.8.2 shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Ratable Share; and
(e) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Obligations are neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (a) or (b) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Lender or any other Lender hereunder, all Letter of Credit Fees payable under Section 2.8.2 with respect to such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Obligations shall be payable to the Issuing Lender (and not to such Defaulting Lender) until and to the extent that such Letter of Credit Obligations are reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
(iv) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, PNC shall not be required to fund any Swing Loans and the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless such Issuing Lender is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lenders then outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations will be 100% covered by the Revolving Credit Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.9(iii), and participating interests in any newly made Swing Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with _Section 2.9(iii)(a)_ (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to any Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue, or (ii) PNC or the Issuing Lender has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, PNC shall not be required to fund any Swing Loan and the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless PNC or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender, satisfactory to PNC or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder. The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this Section 2.9 are in addition to other rights and remedies which the Borrower may have against such Defaulting Lender and which the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender in each case under applicable Law.
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, PNC and the Issuing Lender agree in writing that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, and the Ratable Share of the Swing Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Commitment, and on such date such Lender
41
* * *


shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swing Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Ratable Share.
2.10 _Increase in Revolving Credit Commitments._
2.10.1 _Increasing Lenders and New Lenders_. The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, request that (1) the current Lenders increase their Revolving Credit Commitments (any current Lender which elects to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment shall be referred to as an Increasing Lender) or (2) one or more new lenders (each a New Lender) join this Agreement and provide a Revolving Credit Commitment hereunder, subject to the following terms and conditions:
(i) _No Obligation to Increase_. No current Lender shall be obligated to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment and any increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment by any current Lender shall be in the sole discretion of such current Lender.
(ii) _Defaults_. There shall exist no Events of Default or Potential Default on the effective date of such increase after giving effect to such increase.
(iii) _Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments_. After giving effect to such increase, the total Revolving Credit Commitments shall not exceed $125,000,000.
(iv) _Resolutions; Opinion_. The Loan Parties shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on or before the effective date of such increase the following documents in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent: (1) certifications of their corporate secretaries with attached resolutions certifying that the increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment has been approved by such Loan Parties, and (2) an opinion of counsel addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders addressing the authorization and execution of the Loan Documents by, and enforceability of the Loan Documents against, the Loan Parties.
(v) _Notes_. The Borrowers shall execute and deliver (1) to each Increasing Lender a replacement revolving credit Note reflecting the new amount of such Increasing Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment after giving effect to the increase (and the prior Note issued to such Increasing Lender shall be deemed to be terminated) and (2) to each New Lender a revolving credit Note reflecting the amount of such New Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment.
(vi) _Approval of New Lenders_. Any New Lender shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
(vii) _Increasing Lenders_. Each Increasing Lender shall confirm its agreement to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to an acknowledgement in a form acceptable to the Administrative Agent, signed by it and the Borrower and delivered to the Administrative Agent at least five (5) calendar days before the effective date of such increase.
42
* * *
(viii) _New LendersJoinder_. Each New Lender shall execute a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent pursuant to which such New Lender shall join and become a party to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with a Revolving Credit Commitment in the amount set forth in such lender joinder.
2.11 _Reduction of Revolving Credit Commitment_. The Borrowers shall have the right at any time after the Closing Date upon five (5) calendar days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period of time agreed to by the Administrative Agent) to permanently reduce (ratably among the Lenders in proportion to their Ratable Shares) the Revolving Credit Commitments, in a minimum amount of $500,000 and whole multiples of $500,000, or to terminate completely the Revolving Credit Commitments, without penalty or premium except as set forth herein, including without limitation, in Section 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender], Section 5.8 [Increased Costs] and Section 5.10 [Indemnity]; provided that any such reduction or termination shall be accompanied by prepayment of the Notes, together with outstanding Commitment Fees, and the full amount of interest accrued on the principal sum to be prepaid (and all amounts referred to in Section 5.10 [Indemnity] hereof) to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate Revolving Facility Usage after giving effect to such prepayments to be equal to or less than the Revolving Credit Commitments as so reduced or terminated. Any notice to reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments under this Section 2.11 shall be irrevocable; _provided_ that a notice of termination of all Revolving Credit Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.
3. _RESERVED_
4. _INTEREST RATES_
4.1 _Interest Rate Options._ The Borrower shall pay interest in respect of the outstanding unpaid principal amount of the Loans as selected by it from the Base Rate Option or LIBOR Rate Option set forth below applicable to the Loans, it being understood that, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Borrower may select different Interest Rate Options and different Interest Periods to apply simultaneously to the Loans comprising different Borrowing Tranches and may convert to or renew one or more Interest Rate Options with respect to all or any portion of the Loans comprising any Borrowing Tranche; _provided_ that there shall not be at any one time outstanding more than five (5) Borrowing Tranches in the aggregate among all of the Loans and _provided further_ that if an Event of Default or Potential Default exists and is continuing, the Borrower may not request, convert to, or renew the LIBOR Rate Option for any Loans and the Required Lenders may demand that all existing Borrowing Tranches bearing interest under the LIBOR Rate Option shall be converted immediately to the Base Rate Option, subject to the obligation of the Borrower to pay any indemnity under Section 5.10 [Indemnity] in connection with such conversion. If at any time the designated rate applicable to any Loan made by any Lender exceeds such Lenders highest lawful rate, the rate of interest on such Lenders Loan shall be limited to such Lenders highest lawful rate.
43
* * *


4.1.1 _Revolving Credit Interest Rate Options; Swing Line Interest Rate._ The Borrower shall have the right to select from the following Interest Rate Options applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans:
(i) _Revolving Credit Base Rate Option_ : A fluctuating rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed) equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, such interest rate to change automatically from time to time effective as of the effective date of each change in the Base Rate; or
(ii) _Revolving Credit LIBOR Rate Option_ : A rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed) equal to the LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin.
Subject to Section 4.3 [Interest After Default], only the Base Rate Option applicable to Revolving Credit Loans shall apply to the Swing Loans.
4.1.2 [RESERVED]
4.1.3 _Rate Quotations._ The Borrower may call the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which a Loan Request is to be delivered to receive an indication of the rates then in effect, but it is acknowledged that such projection shall not be binding on the Administrative Agent or the Lenders nor affect the rate of interest which thereafter is actually in effect when the election is made.
4.2 _Interest Periods._ At any time when the Borrower shall select, convert to or renew a LIBOR Rate Option, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such LIBOR Rate Option by delivering a Loan Request. The notice shall specify an Interest Period during which such Interest Rate Option shall apply. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the following provisions shall apply to any selection of, renewal of, or conversion to a LIBOR Rate Option:
4.2.1 _Amount of Borrowing Tranche._ Each Borrowing Tranche of Loans under the LIBOR Rate Option shall be in integral multiples of $500,000 and not less than $1,000,000 and
4.2.2 _Renewals._ In the case of the renewal of a LIBOR Rate Option at the end of an Interest Period, the first day of the new Interest Period shall be the last day of the preceding Interest Period, without duplication in payment of interest for such day.
4.3 _Interest After Default._ To the extent permitted by Law, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and until such time such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived, and at the discretion of the Administrative Agent or upon written demand by the Required Lenders to the Administrative Agent:
4.3.1 _Letter of Credit Fees, Interest Rate._ The Letter of Credit Fees and the rate of interest for each Loan otherwise applicable pursuant to Section 2.8.2 [Letter of Credit Fees] or Section 4.1 [Interest Rate Options], respectively, shall be increased by 2.0% per annum;
44
* * *


4.3.2 _Other Obligations._ Each other Obligation hereunder if not paid when due shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the rate of interest applicable under the Revolving Credit Base Rate Option plus an additional 2.0% per annum from the time such Obligation becomes due and payable and until it is paid in full; and
4.3.3 _Acknowledgment._ The Borrower acknowledges that the increase in rates referred to in this Section 4.3 reflects, among other things, the fact that such Loans or other amounts have become a substantially greater risk given their default status and that the Lenders are entitled to additional compensation for such risk; and all such interest shall be payable by Borrower upon demand by Administrative Agent.
4.4 _LIBOR Rate Unascertainable; Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available._
4.4.1 _Unascertainable._ If on any date on which a LIBOR Rate would otherwise be determined, the Administrative Agent shall have determined that:
(i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining such LIBOR Rate, or
(ii) a contingency has occurred which materially and adversely affects the London interbank eurodollar market relating to the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agents and Lenders Rights].
4.4.2 _Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available._ If at any time any Lender shall have determined that:
(i) the making, maintenance or funding of any Loan to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies has been made impracticable or unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any Law or any interpretation or application thereof by any Official Body or with any request or directive of any such Official Body (whether or not having the force of Law), or
(ii) such LIBOR Rate Option will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lender of the establishment or maintenance of any such Loan, or
(iii) after making all reasonable efforts, deposits of the relevant amount in Dollars for the relevant Interest Period for a Loan, or to banks generally, to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies, respectively, are not available to such Lender with respect to such Loan, or to banks generally, in the interbank eurodollar market, then the Administrative Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agents and Lenders Rights].
4.4.3 _Administrative Agents and Lenders Rights._ In the case of any event specified in Section 4.4.1 [Unascertainable] above, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Lenders and the Borrower thereof, and in the case of an event specified in Section 4.4.2 [Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available] above, such Lender shall promptly so notify the Administrative Agent and endorse a certificate to such notice as to the specific circumstances of such notice, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly send copies of such notice and certificate to the other Lenders and the Borrower. Upon such date as shall be specified in such notice (which shall not be earlier than the date such notice is given), the
45
* * *


obligation of (A) the Lenders, in the case of such notice given by the Administrative Agent, or (B) such Lender, in the case of such notice given by such Lender, to allow the Borrower to select, convert to or renew a LIBOR Rate Option shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall have later notified the Borrower, or such Lender shall have later notified the Administrative Agent, of the Administrative Agents or such Lenders, as the case may be, determination that the circumstances giving rise to such previous determination no longer exist. If at any time the Administrative Agent makes a determination under Section 4.4.1 [Unascertainable] and the Borrower has previously notified the Administrative Agent of its selection of, conversion to or renewal of a LIBOR Rate Option and such Interest Rate Option has not yet gone into effect, such notification shall be deemed to provide for selection of, conversion to or renewal of the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loans. If any Lender notifies the Administrative Agent of a determination under Section 4.4.2 [Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available], the Borrower shall, subject to the Borrowers indemnification Obligations under Section 5.10 [Indemnity], as to any Loan of the Lender to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies, on the date specified in such notice either convert such Loan to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan or prepay such Loan in accordance with Section 5.6 [Voluntary Prepayments]. Absent due notice from the Borrower of conversion or prepayment, such Loan shall automatically be converted to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan upon such specified date.
4.5 _Selection of Interest Rate Options._ If the Borrower fails to select a new Interest Period to apply to any Borrowing Tranche of Loans under the LIBOR Rate Option at the expiration of an existing Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing Tranche in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.2 [Interest Periods], the Borrower shall be deemed to have converted such Borrowing Tranche to the Base Rate Option commencing upon the last day of the existing Interest Period.
5. _PAYMENTS_
5.1 _Payments._ All payments and prepayments to be made in respect of principal, interest, Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, Administrative Agents Fee or other fees or amounts due from the Borrower hereunder shall be payable prior to 1:00 p.m. on the date when due without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, and without set-off, counterclaim or other deduction of any nature, and an action therefor shall immediately accrue. Such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Principal Office for the account of PNC with respect to the Swing Loans and for the ratable accounts of the Lenders with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans in U.S. Dollars and in immediately available funds, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute such amounts to the Lenders in immediately available funds; _provided_ that in the event payments are received by 1:00 p.m. by the Administrative Agent with respect to the Loans and such payments are not distributed to the Lenders on the same day received by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall pay the Lenders the Federal Funds Effective Rate with respect to the amount of such payments for each day held by the Administrative Agent and not distributed to the Lenders. The Administrative Agents and each Lenders statement of account, ledger or other relevant record shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive as the statement of the amount of principal of and interest on the Loans and other amounts owing under this Agreement and shall be deemed an account stated.
46
* * *


5.2 _Pro Rata Treatment of Lenders._ Each borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans shall be allocated to each Lender according to its Ratable Share, and each selection of, conversion to or renewal of any Interest Rate Option and each payment or prepayment by the Borrower with respect to principal, interest, Commitment Fees and Letter of Credit Fees (but excluding the Administrative Agents Fee and the Issuing Lenders fronting fee) shall (except as otherwise may be provided with respect to a Defaulting Lender and except as provided in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agents and Lenders Rights] in the case of an event specified in Section 4.4 [LIBOR Rate Unascertainable; Etc.], 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender] or 5.8 [Increased Costs]) be payable ratably among the Lenders entitled to such payment in accordance with the amount of principal, interest, Commitment Fees, Facility Fees and Letter of Credit Fees, as set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each borrowing or payment or prepayment by the Borrower of principal, interest, fees or other amounts from the Borrower with respect to Swing Loans shall be made by or to PNC according to Section 2.5.5 [Borrowings to Repay Swing Loans].
5.3 _Sharing of Payments by Lenders._ If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff, counterclaim or bankers lien, by receipt of voluntary payment, by realization upon security, or by any other non-pro rata source, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than the pro-rata share of the amount such Lender is entitled thereto, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, _provided_ that:
(i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, together with interest or other amounts, if any, required by Law (including court order) to be paid by the Lender or the holder making such purchase; and
(ii) the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Loan Parties pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of the Loan Documents or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or Participation Advances to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 5.3 shall apply).
Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation but without duplication as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
47
* * *


5.4 _Presumptions by Administrative Agent._ Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
5.5 _Interest Payment Dates._ Interest on Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies shall be due and payable in arrears on each Payment Date. Interest on Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies shall be due and payable on the last day of each Interest Period for those Loans. Interest on mandatory prepayments of principal under Section 5.7 [Mandatory Prepayments] shall be due on the date such mandatory prepayment is due. Interest on the principal amount of each Loan or other monetary Obligation shall be due and payable on demand after such principal amount or other monetary Obligation becomes due and payable (whether on the stated Expiration Date, upon acceleration or otherwise).
5.6 _Voluntary Prepayments._
5.6.1 _Right to Prepay._ The Borrower shall have the right at its option from time to time to prepay the Loans in whole or part without premium or penalty (except as provided in Section 5.6.2 [Replacement of a Lender] below, in Section 5.8 [Increased Costs] and Section 5.10 [Indemnity]). Whenever the Borrower desires to prepay any part of the Loans, it shall provide a prepayment notice to the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of prepayment of the Revolving Credit Loans or no later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of prepayment of Swing Loans, setting forth the following information:
(w) the date, which shall be a Business Day, on which the proposed prepayment is to be made;
(x) a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between the Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Loans;
(y) a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies and Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies; and
(z) the total principal amount of such prepayment, which shall not be less than the lesser of (i) the Revolving Facility Usage or (ii) $500,000 for any Swing Loan or $500,000 for any Revolving Credit Loan.
All prepayment notices shall be irrevocable; _provided_ that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of all Revolving
48
* * *


Credit Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.11 [Reduction of Revolving Credit Commitment], then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.11 [Reduction of Revolving Credit Commitment]. The principal amount of the Loans for which a prepayment notice is given, together with interest on such principal amount except with respect to Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, shall be due and payable on the date specified in such prepayment notice as the date on which the proposed prepayment is to be made. Except as provided in Section 4.4.3 [Administrative Agents and Lenders Rights], if the Borrower prepays a Loan but fails to specify the applicable Borrowing Tranche which the Borrower is prepaying, the prepayment shall be applied first to Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, then to Loans to which the LIBOR Rate Option applies. Any prepayment hereunder shall be subject to the Borrowers Obligation to indemnify the Lenders under Section 5.10 [Indemnity].
5.6.2 _Replacement of a Lender._ In the event any Lender (i) gives notice under Section 4.4 [LIBOR Rate Unascertainable, Etc.], (ii) requests compensation under Section 5.8 [Increased Costs], or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Official Body for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.9 [Taxes], (iii) is a Defaulting Lender, (iv) becomes subject to the control of an Official Body (other than normal and customary supervision), or (v) is a Non-Consenting Lender referred to in Section 11.2 [Modifications, Amendments or Waivers], then in any such event the Borrower may, at its sole expense, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.9 [Successors and Assigns]), all of its interests, rights (other than existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 5.8 [Increased Costs] or 5.9 [Taxes]) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), _provided_ that:
(i) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 11.9 [Successors and Assigns];
(ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and Participation Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 5.10 [Indemnity]) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 5.8.1 [Increased Costs Generally] or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 5.9 [Taxes], such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
(iv) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Law.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
49
* * *


5.7 _Mandatory Prepayments._
5.7.1 _Sale of Assets._ Within five (5) Business Days (or upon receipt if later, but in no event to exceed seventy five (75) after receipt) of any sale of assets authorized by Sections 8.2.7(iv), (v) and (vii) [Disposition of Assets or Subsidiaries], the Borrower shall make a mandatory prepayment of principal on the Revolving Loans equal to the sum of the after-tax proceeds (as estimated in good faith by the Borrower) less any reasonable commissions and other reasonable and customary transaction costs, fees and expenses properly attributable to such sales, subject to Borrowers ability to reborrow Revolving Loans in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.
5.7.2 _Application Among Interest Rate Options._ All prepayments required pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall first be applied among the Interest Rate Options to the principal amount of the Loans subject to the Base Rate Option, then to Loans subject to a LIBOR Rate Option. In accordance with Section 5.10 [Indemnity], the Borrower shall indemnify the Lenders for any loss or expense, including loss of margin, incurred with respect to any such prepayments applied against Loans subject to a LIBOR Rate Option on any day other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period.
5.8 _Increased Costs._
5.8.1 _Increased Costs Generally._ If any Change in Law shall:
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the LIBOR Rate) or the Issuing Lender;
(ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (ii) through (iv) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
(iii) impose on any Lender, the Issuing Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, the Issuing Lender or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, the Issuing Lender or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Issuing Lender or other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, the Issuing Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

5.8.2 _Capital Requirements._ If any Lender or the Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the Issuing Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lenders or the Issuing Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or the Issuing Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders or the Issuing Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lenders or the Issuing Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or the Issuing Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders or the Issuing Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lenders or the Issuing Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered.
5.8.3 _Certificates for Reimbursement; Repayment of Outstanding Loans; Borrowing of New Loans._ A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Sections 5.8.1 [Increased Costs Generally] or 5.8.2 [Capital Requirements] and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.
5.8.4 _Delay in Requests._ Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or the Issuing Lenders right to demand such compensation, _provided_ that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or the Issuing Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the one hundred eighty (180) calendar day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
5.9 _Taxes._
5.9.1 _Issuing Lender_. For purposes of this Section 5.9, the term Lender includes the Issuing Lender.

If any applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall
51
* * *


timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Official Body in accordance with applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 5.9 [Taxes]) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
5.9.3 _Payment of Other Taxes by the Loan Parties._ The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Official Body in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
5.9.4 _Indemnification by the Loan Parties._ The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 5.9 [Taxes]) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable and documented expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Official Body. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
5.9.5 _Indemnification by the Lenders_. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of any of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.9.4 [Participations] relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register, and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Official Body. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 5.9.5 [Indemnification by the Lenders].
5.9.6 _Evidence of Payments._ As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to an Official Body pursuant to this Section 5.9 [Taxes], such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Official Body evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

5.9.7 _Status of Lenders._
(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 5.9.7(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person.
(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
(i) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty;
(ii) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;
53
* * *


(iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of _Exhibit 5.9.7(A)_ to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a **U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate** ) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or
(iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of _Exhibit 5.9.7(B)_ or _Exhibit 5.9.7(C)_ , IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; _provided_ that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of _Exhibit 5.9.7(D)_ on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
Upon reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 5.9.7. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly (and in any event
54
* * *


within twenty (20) calendar days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
5.9.8 _Treatment of Certain Refunds_. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.9 [Taxes] (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 5.9 [Taxes]), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 5.9 [Taxes] with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Official Body with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party incurred in connection with obtaining such refund, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 5.9.8 [Treatment of Certain Refunds] (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Official Body) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Official Body. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.9.8 [Treatment of Certain Refunds]), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 5.9.8 [Treatment of Certain Refunds] the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
5.9.9 _Survival_. Each partys obligations under this Section 5.9 [Taxes] shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations.
5.10 _Indemnity._ In addition to the compensation or payments required by Section 5.8 [Increased Costs]or Section 5.9 [Taxes], the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against all liabilities, losses or expenses (including loss of anticipated profits, any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan, from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract) which such Lender sustains or incurs as a consequence of any:
(i) payment, prepayment, conversion or renewal of any Loan to which a LIBOR Rate Option applies on a day other than the last day of the corresponding Interest Period (whether or not such payment or prepayment is mandatory, voluntary or automatic and whether or not such payment or prepayment is then due),
(ii) attempt by the Borrower to revoke (expressly, by later inconsistent notices or otherwise) in whole or part any Loan Requests under Section 2.4 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests; Swing Loan Requests] or Section 4.2 [Interest Periods] or notice relating to prepayments under Section 5.6 [Voluntary Prepayments], or
55
* * *


(iii) default by the Borrower in the performance or observance of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including any failure of the Borrower to pay when due (by acceleration or otherwise) any principal, interest, Commitment Fee or any other amount due hereunder.
If any Lender sustains or incurs any such loss or expense, it shall promptly upon knowledge of such loss or expense notify the Borrower of the amount determined in good faith by such Lender (which determination may include such assumptions, allocations of costs and expenses and averaging or attribution methods as such Lender shall deem reasonable) to be necessary to indemnify such Lender for such loss or expense. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination. Such amount shall be due and payable by the Borrower to such Lender ten (10) Business Days after such notice is given.
5.11 _Settlement Date Procedures_. In order to minimize the transfer of funds between the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow Swing Loans and PNC may make Swing Loans as provided in Section 2.1.2 [Swing Loan Commitments] hereof during the period between Settlement Dates. The Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of its Ratable Share of the total of the Revolving Credit Loans and the Swing Loans (each a **Required Share** ). On such Settlement Date, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent the amount equal to the difference between its Required Share and its Revolving Credit Loans, and the Administrative Agent shall pay to each Lender its Ratable Share of all payments made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans. The Administrative Agent shall also effect settlement in accordance with the foregoing sentence on the proposed Borrowing Dates for Revolving Credit Loans and on Mandatory Prepayment Dates and may at its option effect settlement on any other Business Day. These settlement procedures are established solely as a matter of administrative convenience, and nothing contained in this Section 5.11 shall relieve the Lenders of their obligations to fund Revolving Credit Loans on dates other than a Settlement Date pursuant to Section 2.1.2 [Swing Loan Commitment]. The Administrative Agent may at any time at its option for any reason whatsoever require each Lender to pay immediately to the Administrative Agent such Lenders Ratable Share of the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and each Lender may at any time require the Administrative Agent to pay immediately to such Lender its Ratable Share of all payments made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans.
5.12 _Mitigation Obligations_. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 5.8, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Official Body for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.9, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or materially reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.8 or 5.9, as the case may be, in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense, (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect and (iv) would not require such Lender to take any action inconsistent with its internal policies or legal or regulatory restrictions. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the Issuing Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.

Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with approval from the Borrower (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, appoint a successor Administrative Agent; _provided_ that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (i) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any

LITIGATION
The Borrowers are subject to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including employment, intellectual property and product liability claims. The Borrowers are not currently party to pending legal proceedings that the Company believes, if adversely determine, could result in a material Adverse Change, with the following possible exceptions.
1. The Company is currently subject to an audit by U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP) in respect of the period from 2006 to 2010. In October 2013, CBP issued the final audit report. In that report CBP projects that unpaid duties totaling approximately $12.4 million are due for the period under review and recommends collection of the duties due. The Company responded that these projections are erroneous and provided arguments that demonstrate the amount due in connection with this matter is considerably less than the projection. Additionally, on December 12, 2014, the Company made an offer to settle CBPs potential claims and tendered $3.5 million. At this time, it is not possible to determine how long it will take CBP to evaluate the Companys offer or to predict whether our offer will be accepted. Likewise, if a settlement cannot be reached, it is not possible to predict with any certainty whether CBP will seek to assert a claim for penalties in addition to any unpaid duties, but such an assertion is a possibility.
2. The Company is currently subject to an audit by the Brazilian Federal Tax Authorities related to imports of footwear from China between 2010-2014. On January 13, 2015, the Company was notified about the issuance of assessments totaling roughly $5.25 million for the period January 2010 through May 2011. The Company has disputed these assessments and asserted defenses to the claims. On February 25, 2015, the Company received additional assessments totaling roughly $11.54 million related to the remainder of the audit period. The Company has filed defenses and an appeal to these claims as well. It is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of this matter.

INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE COLLATERAL
COVENANTS:
At the request of the Administrative Agent, the Loan Parties shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders (x) on the Closing Date and annually thereafter an original certificate of insurance signed by the Loan Parties independent insurance broker describing and certifying as to the existence of the insurance on the Collateral required to be maintained by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with a copy of the endorsement described in the next sentence attached to such certificate, and (y) from time to time a summary schedule indicating all insurance then in force with respect to each of the Loan Parties. Such policies of insurance shall contain special endorsements which include the provisions set forth below or are otherwise in form acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion. The applicable Loan Parties shall notify the Administrative Agent promptly of any occurrence causing a material loss or decline in value of the Collateral and the estimated (or actual, if available) amount of such loss or decline. Any monies received by the Administrative Agent constituting insurance proceeds may, at the option of the Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of property insurance proceeds received during the existence of an Event of Default, be applied by the Administrative Agent to the payment of the Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, (ii) for losses of less than $5,000,000 received at such time as no Event of Default or Potential Default exists, be disbursed by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Loan Parties, and (iii) for losses equal to or greater than $5,000,000 received at such time as no Event of Default or Potential Default exists, be disbursed by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Loan Parties on such terms as are deemed appropriate by the Administrative Agent for the repair, restoration and/or replacement of Collateral and other property in respect of which such proceeds were received.
ENDORSEMENT:
(i) specify the Administrative Agent as an additional insured, mortgagee and lender loss payee as its interests may appear,
(ii) with respect to all property insurance policies, provide that the interest of the Lenders shall be insured regardless of any breach or violation by the applicable Loan Parties of any warranties, declarations or conditions contained in such policies or any action or inaction of the applicable Loan Parties or others insured under such policies, except that the insurer shall not be obligated to maintain the insurance if the breach consists of non-payment of premiums which continues for 30 days after written notice to Administrative Agent,
(iii) provide a waiver of any right of the insurers to set off or counterclaim or any other deduction, whether by attachment or otherwise,
(iv) provide that any and all rights of subrogation which the insurers may have or acquire against the Loan Parties shall be, at all times and in all respects, junior and subordinate to the prior
* * *


Payment In Full of the Indebtedness hereunder and that no insurer shall exercise or assert any right of subrogation until such time as the Indebtedness hereunder has been paid in full and the Commitments have terminated,
(v) provide that no cancellation of such policies for any reason (including non-payment of premium) nor any change therein shall be effective until at least thirty (30) days after receipt by the Administrative Agent of written notice of such cancellation or change,
(vi) be primary without right of contribution of any other insurance carried by or on behalf of any additional insureds with respect to their respective interests in the Collateral, and
(vii) provide that inasmuch as the policy covers more than one insured, all terms, conditions, insuring agreements and endorsements (except limits of liability) shall operate as if there were a separate policy covering each insured.

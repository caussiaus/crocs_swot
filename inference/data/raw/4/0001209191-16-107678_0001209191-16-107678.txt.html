Each restricted stock unit represents the contingent right to receive one share of the issuer's common stock.  The restricted stock units vest as follows:  (i) 52,492 of the restricted stock units vest in three equal annual installments on March 8, 2017, March 8, 2018 and March 8, 2019, provided that the reporting person remains employed by the issuer as of each vesting date, and (ii) up to 213,150 of the restricted stock units vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the date in 2017 that the issuer's compensation committee certifies that certain performance metrics are achieved, provided that the reporting person remains employed by the issuer as of each vesting date.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Adjusted to reflect 166,691 restricted stock units that were cancelled as certain performance metrics relating to the vesting of such awards were not achieved.</footnote>
